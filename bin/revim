# Reopen a previously automatically saved vim session (see vimrc)

# TODO assumes that you've not got any newlines in your session names, because
#      chronological order is a PAIN with find.
# TODO Write completions
# TODO selection mode
# TODO I have a script "revim" in ~/bin to reopen the last session either from
#      the current directory, a given directory or globally. This is more
#      powerful than what you'd get using viminfo, as it can sort of restore
#      tabs and window splits.
