# man page excerpt, for your convenience:
#
# The time and date fields are:
#
#        field          allowed values
#        -----          --------------
#        minute         0-59
#        hour           0-23
#        day of month   1-31
#        month          1-12 (or names, see below)
#        day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sunday, or use names)
#
# A field may contain an asterisk (*), which always stands for "first-last".
#
# Ranges of numbers are allowed.  Ranges are two numbers separated with a
# hyphen.  The specified range is inclusive.  For example, 8-11 for an 'hours'
# entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10, and 11. The first number must be
# less than or equal to the second one.
#
# Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by
# commas.  Examples: "1,2,5,9", "0-4,8-12".
#
# Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Following a range with
# "/<number>" specifies skips of the number's value through the range.  For
# example, "0-23/2" can be used in the 'hours' field to specify command
# execution for every other hour (the alternative in the V7 standard is
# "0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22").  Step  values  are  also permitted after an
# asterisk, so if specifying a job to be run every two hours, you can use "*/2".
#
# Names can also be used for the 'month' and 'day of week' fields.  Use the
# first three letters of the particular day or month (case does not matter).
# Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.
