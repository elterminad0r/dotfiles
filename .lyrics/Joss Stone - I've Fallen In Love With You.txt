I've fallen I love with you
Please tell me, tell me what else was there to do
When feelin' lips like yours
And looking into eyes like yours
Whoa well I might as well face it 'cause it's true
Yes, I've fallen I love with you

Whoa oh my beating heart wants you
And my empty arms need you
Don't you go, please stay
And never try to send me away

I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen in love

I've fallen in love with you
And you've just got to feel the same way too
When you embraced me last night
Lord knows it was pure, such pure delight

Whoa oh my beating heart wants you
And my empty arms need you
Don't you go, please stay
And never try to send me away
Oh yes my love, oh yes my love
My darlin' yeah yeah yeah

I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen in love

I've fallen so deep in love you see
Until you become the very soul of me
Oh lemme tell ya something I don't care who knows
Anyway all over, all over my face it shows
Said I'm talkin' bout love this time
Oh yes I am
And ya know what, it's not a school-girl crush

Whoa oh my beating heart wants you
And my empty arms need you
Don't you go, please stay
And never try to send me away
My beating heart wants you
And my empty arms need you
Don't you go please stay
And never try to send me away

I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen in love
