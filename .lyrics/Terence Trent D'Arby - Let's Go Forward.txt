Let's go forward with our love
I don't ask for your money
I don't ask for your honey
All I want is love
Let's go forward with our love
I don't ask for your wallet
Let's finish what we started
All I need is love

And in your private moments
When all the world is sleep
I watch you as you toss and turn
And pray my soul you'll keep
I sense you are afraid
That I'm not holding fast
But you are just nervous
And I'm certain that this too will pass

Let's go forward with our love
I don't ask for your money
I don't ask for your honey
All I want is love

Our dedication wanders
You're hurt from what you hear
But then the rain falls down
And wipes away your tears
The stars are everlasting
But even they shift from time to time
If we just slow down
Catch our breath
We'll be fine

Let's go forward with our love
I don't ask for your wallet
Let's finish what we started
All I need is love

Silver turns to black
And gold turns into green
Giving my love back
Would tear away our seed
Like real silver and gold
We can keep our vows
Your hand I will hold
Until the killing ground
Let's go forward with our love
