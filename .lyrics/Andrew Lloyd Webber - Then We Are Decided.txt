Caiaphas
We've been sitting on the fence for far too long

Annas
Why let him upset us?
Caiaphas, let him be
All those imbeciles will see
He really doesn't matter

Caiaphas
Jesus is important
We've let him go his way before
And while he starts a major war
We theorize and chatter

Annas
He's just another scripture thumping hack from Galilee

Caiaphas
The difference is they call him King
The difference frightens me
What about the Romans?
When they see King Jesus crowned
Do you think they'll stand around
Cheering, and applauding?
What about our people?
If they see we've lost our nerve
Don't you think that they deserve
Something more rewarding

Annas
They've got what they want
They think so, anyway
If he's what they want
Why take their toy away?
He's a craze

Caiaphas
Put yourself in my place
I can hardly step aside
Can not let my hands be tied
I am law and order
What about our priesthood?
Don't you see that we could fall?
If we are to last at all
We can not be divided

Annas
Then say so to the council
But don't rely on subtlety
Frighten them, or they won't see

Caiaphas
Then we are decided?

Annas
Then we are decided
