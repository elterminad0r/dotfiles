As the light hits you
As you shift along the floor
I find it hard to place my face
How did I come to be here anyway?
It's terribly vague what's gone before

I could have been anyone
You could have been anyone's dream
Why did you have to choose our moment?
Why did you have to make me feel that?
Why did you make it so unreal?

O-o-oh to be in love, and never get out again
O-o-oh to be in love, and never get out again
O-o-oh to be in love, never get out again

O-o-oh to be in love, and never get out again
O-o-oh to be in love, and never get out again
O-o-oh to be in love, never get out again

All the colours look brighter now
Everything they say seems to sound new
Slipping into tomorrow too quick
Yesterday always too good to forget
Stop the swing of the pendulum, let us through

O-o-oh to be in love, and never get out again
O-o-oh to be in love, and never get out again
Oh to be in love, never get out again
