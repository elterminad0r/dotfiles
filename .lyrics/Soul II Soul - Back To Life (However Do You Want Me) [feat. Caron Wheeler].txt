Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality

Could be there for you

Back from a fantasy, yeah

I'll leave it in your hands until you're ready, oh

No more room for trouble or fuss
Need a change, a positive change
Look, it's me writing on the wall

Back to life back to the day we have
Let's end this foolish game
Hear me out, don't let me waste away
Make up your mind so I know where I stand

However do you want me
