I couldn't sleep last night wondering where were you?
In your mind I mean
Why didn't you scream?
Though I say the wrong thing now and then
I still love you

In my hour of passionate thought
You know I say things that I ought (not to)
And though we may not stay together
I still love you

All alone now long down the line
And still these tear storms loneliness finds
But like the tide that rises
Slaps against the beach and falls
And though it's no longer my pail to pull and all
And though the weight of all our years
Their silent whispers call

I still love you
I still love you
I still love you
