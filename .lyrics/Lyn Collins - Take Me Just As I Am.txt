Baby, here I am
Take me, take me just as I am
Baby, here I am
Take me, take me just as I am

I may not be rich
Got diamond, minks, and gold
But I got something, brother
Bound to satisfy your soul
Baby, here I am
Take me, take me just as I am

Don't look for no princess
Princesses don't have a thing
Nothing they can do for you
But reach for what you bring
Baby, here I am
Take me, take me just as I am

Hey, but, but, but
But, but, but

I am a soul sister
With nothing but knowhow, now
I know how to make a liver quiver
And I know how to make a love come down
I can make you wanna leave this town

Baby, bring a good thing home
Baby, bring a good thing home

Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home

Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home

Hey, baby, hey baby
Here I am

Baby, here I am
Take me, take me just as I am
Baby, here I am
Take me, take me just as I am

I may not be rich
Got diamond, minks, and gold
But I got something, brother
Bound to satisfy your soul
Baby, here I am
Take me, take me just as I am

Oh, baby
Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home

Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
Baby, bring your good thing home
