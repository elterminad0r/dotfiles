Sweet child in time
You'll see the line
The line that's drawn between
Good and bad

See the blind man
Shooting at the world
Bullets flying
Oh, taking toll

If you've been bad
Oh Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit
Oh, by flying lead

You'd better close your eyes
Ooh, bow your head
Wait for the ricochet

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah, I wanna hear you sing

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

Sweet child in time
You'll see the line
The line that's drawn between
Good and bad

See the blind man
Shooting at the world
Bullets flying
Mmm, taking toll

If you've been bad
Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit
Oh, by flying lead

You'd better close your eyes
Ooh, bow your head
Wait for the ricochet

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah, I gotta hear you sing

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Aah

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

Oh, oh, oh
Oh no
Oh, oh no, oh
Uh, uh
Ain't gonna do, oh no!
Oh, oh no!
Ah, ah, oh
Ah! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh, ah!
Ah!
