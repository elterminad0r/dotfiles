There were Jewish musicians who
Who's life music was

A Jewish wedding or a Jewish holiday
Can not go by without shedding a lot of tears
We must do a lot of crying

We cry always
When a baby is born we cry
Why, tears of joy
When the baby becomes Bar or Bat Mitswa we cry
When we leave them to the weddings, to the choepa, we cry

All nations the world over, all people
Whenever they celebrate the new year
They dance into the new year
We swim into ours, we used to say
Because if you went into the Rosj Hasjana
If you walked into the synagogue
You could swim into the ocean of tears

Oi va voi, this is your name, Oi va voi
