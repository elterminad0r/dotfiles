I'm gointa get up in the mornin
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gointa get up in the mornin
I believe I'll dust my broom
Girlfriend the black man you've been lovin'
Girlfriend can get my room

I'm gonna write a letter
Telephone everytown I know
I'm gonna write a letter
Telephone every town I know
If I can't find her in West Helena
She must be in East Monroe I know

I don't want no woman
Wants every downtown man she meets
I don't want no woman
Wants every downtown man she meets
She's a no good dooney
They shouldn't allow her on the street

I believe, I believe I'll go back home
I believe, I believe I'll go back home
You can mistreat me here babe
But you can't when I'm back home

And I'm gettin' up in the mornin
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gettin' up in the mornin
I believe I'll dust my broom
Girlfriend the black man you been lovin'
Girlfriend can get my room

I'm gonna call up Chiney
See is my good girl over there
I'm gonna call up China
See is my good girl over there
I can't find her on Philippine's island
She must be in Ethiopia somewhere
