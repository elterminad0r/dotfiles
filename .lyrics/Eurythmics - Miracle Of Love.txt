How many sorrows
Do you try to hide
In a world of illusion
That's covering your mind?

I'll show you something good
Oh, I'll show you something good

When you open your mind
You'll discover the sign
That there's something you're longing to find

The miracle of love
Will take away your pain
When the miracle of love
Comes your way again

Cruel is the night
That covers up your fears
Tender is the one
That wipes away your tears

There must be a bitter breeze
To make you sting so viciously
They say the greatest coward
Can hurt the most ferociously

But I'll show you something good
Oh, I'll show you something good

If you open your heart
You can make a new start
When your crumbling world falls apart

The miracle of love
Will take away your pain
When the miracle of love
Comes your way again

The miracle of love (must take a miracle)
Will take away your pain (must take a miracle)
When the miracle of love (must take a miracle)
Comes your way again (must take a miracle)

The miracle of love
Will take away your pain
When the miracle of love
Comes your way again

The miracle of love
Will take away your pain
When the miracle of love
Comes your way again

The miracle of love (must take a miracle)
Will take away your pain (must take a miracle)
When the miracle of love (must take a miracle)
Comes your way again (must take a miracle)

The miracle of love (must take a miracle)
Will take away your pain (must take a miracle)
When the miracle of love (must take a miracle)
Comes your way again (must take a miracle)

The miracle of love (must take a miracle)
Will take away your pain (must take a miracle)
When the miracle of love (must take a miracle)
Comes your way again (must take a miracle)
