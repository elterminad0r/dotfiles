Getting to know you
Was one of the things that I chose to do
Baby I love you
And the world that surrounds you

Mmm, now that I know you
As one of the things that makes life real
Baby I love you
And the world that surrounds you

Gettin' to know you
Is one of the things I hold so dear
A love like this
I never knew I could feel

Ooh, to think that I loved you
After all of the things that I put you through
Baby I love you
And the world that surrounds you

Getting to feel you
Was one of the things I've grown to feel
Baby I love you
And the world that surrounds you

I said getting to show you
Some of the things you make me see
Baby I love you
And the world that surrounds you

Well, getting to know you (hey baby)
Is one of the things I hold so dear
A love like this
I never knew I could feel

Oh, to think that I loved you
After all of the things that I've put you through
Baby, hey, I love you
And the world that surrounds you
Baby I love you
Baby, baby I love you (x2)
And the world that surrounds you, baby
Baby, baby I love you (x2)
And the world that surrounds you
Baby, baby I love you (x2)
Ooh, sweet baby, hey baby
Baby, baby I love you (x2)

Oh, hey hey

Well, getting to know you (yeah baby)
Is one of the things I hold so dear
A love like this I never knew I could feel

Ooh, to think that I loved you
After all of the things that I put you through
Baby I love you
And the whole wide world that surrounds you
Turn around, back up and hit me with it

Baby, baby I love you (x2)
