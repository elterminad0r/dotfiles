Bright lights, big city
They've gone to my baby's head
Bright lights, big city
They've gone to my baby's head
Don't wanna try to tell a woman
But she don't believe the words I said

Alright, pretty baby
Gonna need my help someday
Alright, pretty baby
Gonna need my help someday
You're gonna wish you haven't listened
To some of other things I said

Go ahead, pretty baby
Honey, just knock yourself out
Oh go ahead, pretty baby
Honey, just knock yourself out
I still love you baby
'Cause you don't know what it's all about

Bright lights, big cities
They went to my baby's head
Bright lights, big cities
They went to my baby's head
I hope you remember
Just some of those things I said
