Hey, Bob, I'm looking at what, uh, Jack was talking about and, uh, it's definitely not a particle that's nearby. It is a, uh, bright object and it's, uh, obviously rotating because it's flashing.

It's, uh, way out in the distance, apparently rotating in a very rhythmic fashion because the, uh, flashes come around almost on time. As we look back at the Earth it's, uh, up at about eleven o'clock, about, uh, well, maybe 10 or 12 diame-Earth diameters, uh. I don't know whether that does you any good, but there's something out there.
