Here I am
And I'm out here amongst them
And there is nothing before me but thang

My mom once said
Son you got to be cool
'Cause there is nothing before you but thang

Now how in the hell
Can I be a good boy
When there is nothing before you but thang

The good is bad
But the badder the better
When there is nothing before you but thang

My mouth is getting dry
You know what I mean
My mind is getting so high
Can you dig what I mean
Don't make me tell no lie
Can you dig what I mean

There's nothing before me but thang
There's nothing before me but thang
There's nothing before me but thang

It's good to be hard
But it's good to be good
When there is nothing before you but thang

I've learned to live
And to give is to live
When there is nothing before you but thang

Turn right Turn left
When you can't help yourself
When there is nothing before you but thang

There's good there's bad
But a thang is a thang
And there is nothing before you but thang

There's nothing before mo but thang
There's nothing before me but thang
