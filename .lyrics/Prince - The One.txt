If u're lookin' 4 the man that will walk away from responsibility
I ain't the one {x3}
And if u're lookin' 4 the brotha that'll treat you like anything but a
Queen
I ain't the one

But if u're lookin' 4 a man that'll sweep you off your tired weary feet
Pay your bills, buy you pretty dresses
And take you anywhere you wanna eat
Make love 2 u every night of the week
Oh, don't think it over, girl
Look no further
I am the one
Oh yes I am

If u're lookin' 4 a man that'll make big money
And keep it all 2 himself
I ain't the one
No, no - not me
And if u're lookin' 4 a man that'll have 10 women
And confuse it all with his wealth
Listen here, I ain't that one
No, no no - wait a minute

If u're lookin' 4 a man who can share his dinero (his money)
Buy you half the town (half the town)
Treat every step you take (every step)
As if u're walkin', huh, on holy ground (holy ground)
Place u, place you above all others


When it comes, when it comes 2 the gettin' on down (down)
Look no further, ooh
Your man's around (he's around)
Oh yes he is

He's standing right here, right here (right here, right here)
Don't you look no further, girl
He's standing right here, right here

(I am the one) {x2}

If u're lookin' 4 a man that'll make you feel like time has just begun,
Ooh
A man that'll make you feel like u're the only thing that ever
Mattered
Underneath the sun, underneath the sun, ooh
If u're lookin' 4 somebody
Who will turn your bad day into one long night of fun
Look no further, baby
I'mÂ¡ I'm the one

Oh yes I am
I am the one
Don't you look no further, girl
Oh, I am the one
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh
My, my, my little mayte
