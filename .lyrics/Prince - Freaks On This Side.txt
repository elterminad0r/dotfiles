Freaks on this side, the freaks on this side {x8}

When you can't find the reason 4 the smoke
There's probably water in the fire
When everything you know ain't enough 2 float your boat
And u're lookin' 4 somethin' that'll take you higher

U got 2 get down (freaks on this side, the freaks on this side)
2 a brand new sound (freaks on this side, the freaks on this side)
In the water u'll drown (freaks on this side, the freaks on this
Side)
But the lost is found (freaks on this side, the freaks on this side)

Come on, baby

When confusion tries 2 tear your world apart
And the demons fight 4 power
That's the time you got 2 listen 2 your heart
No one knows the final hour

When you see an illusion everywhere you look
When you know the process of creation
When you understand everything in every book
Congratulations - u're in the new power generation!


(Freaks on this side, the freaks on this side) {x4}
The freaks on this side! {x3}

When everybody calls the truth by a different name
And the indifference between us still remains
God is love, love is God - simple and plain
Party in this way, there's so much more 2 gain

(Freaks on this side, the freaks on this side) {repeat 2 end}

(Get on down, down, down, down, down)
Freaks on this side
We drownin' (get on down, down, down, down, down)
Yeah, yeah
U got 2 get down
(U got 2 get down) {x2}

It's new power generation
And u're groovin' 2 another jam of the year
Think it ain't when it is
And we be drownin'
Glug, glug like a mug

Looka here - freak on this side
The freaks on this side
Looka here - on this side
On this side
The freaks onÂ¡ u got it on this side
