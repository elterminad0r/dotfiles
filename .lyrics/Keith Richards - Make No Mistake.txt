Make no mistake about it mm, but things ain't what they seem
I'm gonna scream and shout it, this is just a dream.

A simple conversation, every now and then
A touchy situation yeah, fascinates a man.

(What shall I do, if I should see you)
(And have to pretend that we have never met ?)

It's not a cheap sensation when you touch me with your hand
A little complication but it can hypnotize a man.

How we gonna hide it ? This thing with you and me yeah
Everyone can tell by now, I just can't lie, you see.

(What shall I say to hide it ?) to hide it baby
(No words can convey your lips melting into mine).

(No mistake, no mistake) make no mistake baby (make no mistake)
(Make no mistake) about it (no mistake) mmm (make no mistake) mmm c'mon.

Make no mistake about it, I'm gonna make you mine
No need to talk it over, we're running out of time.

(I've made up my mind about you, oh)
(I know in my heart that you have the same point of view).

(No mistake) this is it (no mistake, make no mistake) mistake
(Make no mistake) ooh (no mistake) make no mistake baby (make no mistake) oh baby
Oh yeah (Make no mistake) make no mistake (make no mistake) ...
