Punky punky punk
Said you're gonna punky punky punk

New wave, new phrase
New wave, new craze

Going to a party
And I hope you are hearty
So please don't be naughty
For it's a Punky Reggae Party

It takes a joyful sound
To make the world go round
Come with your heart and soul
Come rock your bone

It's a punky reggae party
And it's tonight
It's a Punky Reggae Party
And it's alright

What did you say?

Protected by society
Treated with impunity
Protected by my dignity
I search for reality

New wave, new craze
New wave, new phrase

I'm saying...
The Wailers will be there
The Damned, The Jam, The Clash
Maytals will be there
Dr. Feelgood too

Well it's a punky reggae party
And it's tonight
It's a Punky Reggae Party
And it's alright

A tip from a gypsy
She said "Man you're getting tipsy"
Hiding from reality
In your world of hypocrisy
In your world of hypocrisy
In your world of hypocrisy
In your world of hypocrisy
In your world oh hypocrisy

Good God!

A bubble, a bubble
Looking for no trouble
But if you trouble, trouble
We'll give it to you double

Let me tell you

It takes a joyful sound
To make the world go round
It takes a joyful sound
So come and rock your bone

'Cause it's a punky reggae party
And it's tonight
Well it's a punky reggae party
And it's alright

A tip from a gypsy
She said "Man you're getting tipsy"
Hiding from reality
In your world of hypocrisy
In your world of hypocrisy
Hiding from reality
In your world of hypocrisy
In your world of hypocrisy

A bubble, a bubble
We're looking for no trouble

New wave, new phrase
New wave, new craze
