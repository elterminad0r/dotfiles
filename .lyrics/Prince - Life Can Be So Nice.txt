This morning there was joy in my heart
For I know that I love you so
Scrambled eggs are so boring
For you're all, all that I wanna know

Kisses never lie
When delivered with milk from your lips
Morning glories (never) cry
My love 4 U, baby, drips

Oh, life can be so nice
It's a wonderful world, sweet paradise
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Life can be so nice, so nice

Life can be so nice

No one plays the clarinet the way you play my heart
I come a thousand different ways before I even start
You're so nice

Shivering madly in your embrace is better than a trip
(Shivering madly in your embrace)
Morning glories never cry, my love is just a-drippin'
(Better than a trip)

Scrambled eggs are boring, mama, you're all I wanna know
(Morning glorified in every way)
This morning there was joy in my heart 'cause I know that I love you so, shit
(My love 4 U, baby, drips)

So nice
(I know, yes sir)

Life can be so nice
It's a wonderful world, paradise (so nice)
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Life can be so nice (life can be so nice)

Life can be so nice
It's a wonderful world, paradise
Kiss me once, kiss me twice (drip)
Life can be so nice, so nice
So nice
