Everyone come behold
Christopher Tracy's Parade
The show will proceed
Unless it should rain strawberry lemonade

Hopefully, that will not occur
The man above has been paid
Give what you can, all you can stand
And all of your life will be made

Everyone should come and dig
Christopher Tracy's piano
The chord strikes, the devil no like
So he runs to his evil car

Everyone come behold
Christopher Tracy's Parade
Goodness will guide us if love is inside us
Christopher Tracy's Parade (Christopher Tracy's Parade)
