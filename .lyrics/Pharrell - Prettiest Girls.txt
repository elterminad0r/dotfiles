Pretty girl, pretty girl
Oh, no, here comes a pretty girl, pretty girl
Uh, oh, here comes a pretty girl
Hey!

I know what you are thinking
I know what you will say
You made up this whole far fetched thing
About the reasons that I have changed

Well, I'm still the tiger
And the jungle's still my home
But she blew out my fire
And now my killer instincts are gone
What did you do?

Everything lost its worth to me
Everything in this world
Everything did occur to me that
You are the prettiest girls

My life is so amazing
Let me explain how it got that way
Well, if happiness was standing at your door
I mean tell me what would you say?

But I am no liar
And you rearranged my home
And I wonder how I don't get tired
Of loving the three of you instead of what I own
All that is gone

Everything lost its worth to me
Everything in this world
Everything did occur to me that
You are the prettiest girls

What are you doing to me?
What's so drastic all my friends see?
You say, nothing, nothing, nothing
But it's really something, something, something

You won't answer me
And all the while
My heart just melts
From your innocent smile

It's strange
Oh, god, I think I've changed

Ooh
There's one thing that's sure
Is everyday I love you some more
My hand's been handcuffed and loved by you
So is there really anything I could do?
When

Everything lost its worth to me
Everything in this world
Everything did occur to me that
You are the prettiest girls
