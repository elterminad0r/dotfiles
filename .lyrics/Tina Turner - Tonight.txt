Everything will be alright tonight

Everything's gonna be alright tonight.
No one moves
No one grooves
No one talks
No one talks tonight
Tonight.

Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight.
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks

No one talks tonight
Tonight.

I will love you till I reach the end
I will love you till I reach the end.
I will love you till I die

I will see you in the sky tonight
Tonight.

Everyone will be alright tonight
...
