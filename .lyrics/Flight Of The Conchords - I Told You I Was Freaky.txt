Girl... I'm gonna take the month of August off... just to get you off
I'm freaky... I'm gonna clear the table top, we're gonna need a mop, I'm freaky

Let's take a photo of a goat in a boat
And then we can float in the moat and be freaky
Freaky
Let's take my body and we'll cover it with honey
Stick some money to the honey, now I'm covered in money, honey
I go outside onto the ledge and push my ass against the glass
You can act like you don't know me
I take a cup and then I put it on my head
And I just stand there being freaky with a cup on my head

I told you I was freaky (I told you I was freaky baby)
You didn't believe me (Don't look at me)
I told you I was freaky (Look at me)
Girl, let's get freaky

Let's make two life-size cardboard cut-outs of our bodies
And then pose them into sensual positions
I'll paint the wallpaper pattern onto your naked skin
Stand against the wallpaper and get off like chameleons
I'll flip some clips on my lips, I'll clip some chips to your hips
I'll nibble chips off your hips and watch the moon eclipse
I'll go outside and get some leaves and pretend to be a tree
You can be a squirrel, and store my nuts for me

I told you I was freaky (He told you he was freaky baby)
You didn't believe me (Take that off)
I told you I was freaky (Put this on)
Girl, I do this shit weekly

I want to fly so high in the sky and see what our love brings
Let's steal my roommate's pillow feathers and make some homemade wings
Gonna fly so high on makeshift pillow wings
Girl, can you believe we're flying on homemade pillow wings?

Here I am all dressed in snakeskin
Now I'm in your kitchen making love to your cake tin
Oh no, is this the one you bake in?
I told you I was freaky did you think I was fakin'?
At 8PM I sell my underpants on eBay
At half-past nine I hold a seance in your hallway
At ten o'clock I ask some ghosts for a three way
Yes it's creepy, I told you I was freaky.

Ow!
Ow ow ow!

I told you I was freekie, baby!
I told you I was freekie, baby!
