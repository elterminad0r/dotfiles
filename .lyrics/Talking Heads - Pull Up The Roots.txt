Hello again
Yes, indeed, my friend
I can tell
Goin' together again
I could be right
I could be wrong
I feel nice when I sing this song
And I don't mind
Whatever happens is fine

Baby likes to keep on playing
What do I know, what do I know?
Wilder than the place we live in
I'll take you there, I'll take you there
I don't mind some slight disorder
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots
I know every living creature
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots

And I know you
I understand what you do
Yes indeed
I put the hat on my head
Come outta your mess
Bring yourself in
I feel nice when I start to sing
And I can see
That everyone else is like me

Towns that disappeared completely
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots
Miles and miles of endless highway
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots
Colored lights and shiny curtains
I'll take you there, I'll take you there
Everything has been forgiven
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots

Well I have a good time
When I go out of my mind
And it's a wonderful place
And I can't wait to be there
I hear beautiful sounds
Comin' outta the ground
Gonna take us a while
But we'll go hundreds of times

Baby likes to keep on playing
What do you know, what do you know?
Wilder than the place we live in
I'll take you there, I'll take you there
And I don't mind some slight disorder
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots
And no more time for talkin' it over
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots

Well I have a good time
When I go out of my mind
And it's a wonderful place
And I can't wait to be there
And I hear beautiful sounds
Comin' outta the ground
Someone musta been high
But I guess it's all right
