They call her the lady of the night
She's a woman of the world
And easy-living girl with love for sale

That's what they call her the lady of the night
No one seems to know her name
And even less about the place
From where she came

Every evening when the night is close at hand
You'll find the lady on the Rue d'Avignon
In a half lit hotel doorway the lady advertises warmly
It's just a job but she'll do the best she can

Don't try to change this lady of the night
She's a lot like you and me
And less than what she seems to be

(She is the lady of the night)
And easy-living girl
(She is the lady of the night)
She's a woman of the world
(She is the lady of the night)
With lots of loving for sale
(She is the lady of the night)
Lady lady of the night

Round here they call her the lady of the night
In a perfume hotel room
Shadows dance upon the wall and fate at dawn
She's no beginner this lady of the night
Never try that funny stuff
'Cause lady can be tough
Be warned!

(She is the lady of the night)
She's a lot like you and me
(She is the lady of the night)
And never just what she seems
(She is the lady of the night)
No one seems to know her name
(She is the lady of the night)
Or the place from where she came
