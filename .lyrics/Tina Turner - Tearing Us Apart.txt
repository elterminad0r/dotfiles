You know the sun is shining
It's raining in my heart
I don't know what to do
Since we've been apart
Why don't you tell me, babe
What is going on
You know I love you darling
Don't want to be alone

They're tearing us apart
They're breaking up my heart
I knew it from the start
Your friends are tearing us apart

You know I can't go on
Feeling this old way
You know my heart is burning
It's burning everyday
You know I love you, baby
No one else will do
Why don't you reconsider
Do what I want you to

They're tearing us apart
They're breaking up my heart
I knew it from the start
Your friends are tearing us apart
