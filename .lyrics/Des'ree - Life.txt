I'm afraid of the dark,
'Specially when I'm in a park
And there's no one else around,
Ooh, I get the shivers

I don't want to see a ghost,
It's a sight that I fear most
I'd rather have a piece of toast
And watching the evening news

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Doo, doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Oh life, doo, doot dooo

I'm a superstitious girl,
I'm the worst in the world
Never walk under ladders,
I keep a rabbit's tail

I'll take you up on a dare,
Anytime, anywhere
Name the place, I'll be there,
Bungee jumping, I don't care!

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Doo, doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Doo doot doo
Life
Doo doot doo, doo doot doo, doo


So after all is said and done
I know I'm not the only one
Life indeed can be fun,
If you really want to

Sometimes living out your dreams,
Ain't as easy as it seems
You wanna fly around the world,
In a beautiful balloon

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Doo doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Doo doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Doo doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo doot doot dooo

Doo doot doot dooo...
Oh life, oh life, oh life...
