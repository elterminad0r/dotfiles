She was a paragon of soft scented chinois curls
She stood with nothing on
As we watched my flag unfurl
We fell in love so fast
That it spun my head around
Her coffee tawny skin
Sent my blood pressure up and down
Castilian blue
Castilian blue
I never ever thought
I'd be so taken by a girl like you

Lavender scented pillows
Gave a smell to her room
That when I smell it now
Sends my heart into a sad mood
Black men and her commitments
She had a problem with
And the mention of her father
Would cause her to get very miffed at me
Castilian blue
Castilian blue
I never ever thought
I'd be so taken by a girl like you

Bon bons and fishnet stockings
Used to settle any score
Till one day I felt the breeze awake me
Coming in through an open door
Recurring dreams
I see her in Mirabella Magazine
Multi-coloured babies
Running round behind her knee
She's long, long, gone
Castilian blue
Castilian blue
I never ever thought
I'd be so taken by a girl like you
