You didn't try to call me, why didn't you try?
I'm so lonely
No matter who I take home, I keep calling your name
And you, (I need you so bad) you're the one babe

Tell me, tell me who's lovin' you now
'Cause it worries my mind and I can't sleep at all
I stayed home on Friday just to wait for your call
And you didn't try to call me

Why didn't you try, I'm so lonely
No matter who I take home, I keep calling your name
And you, (I need you so bad) You're the one babe

Tell me, tell me who's lovin' you now
'Cause it worries my mind and I can't sleep at all
I stayed home on Friday just to wait for your call

I can't say what's wrong or what's right
La la-la-la la, la la-la-la la
All you've gotta do-do-do is call me babe
La la-la-la la, la la-la-la la

You make me feel so excited girl
I got so hung up on you from the moment that we met
That no matter how I try, I can't keep the tears
From running down my face
I'm all alone at my place

You didn't try to call me
You didn't try to call me at all... (didja, buddy?) didja?
You didn't try to call me
You didn't try to call me at all... didja?
You didn't try to call me
You didn't try to call me at all... didja?
You didn't try to call me
You didn't try to call me at all... or didja?
