It was 7:45 we were all in line
To greet the teacher Miss Kathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy
Third in line was me

All of us were ordinary
Compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose

Her favorite number was 20
And every single day
If you asked her what she had for breakfast
This is what she'd say

Starfish and Coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds and a tangerine
A side order of ham

If you set your mind free baby
Maybe you'll understand
Starfish and Coffee
Maple syrup and jam

Cynthia wore the prettiest dress
But different color socks
Sometimes, I wondered
If the mates were in her lunchbox

Me and Lucy opened it
When Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died
You know what we found?

Starfish and Coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham

If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'll understand
Starfish and Coffee
Maple syrup and jam, oh

(Starfish and Coffee)

Cynthia had a happy face
Just like the one she draws
On every wall, in every school
But it's all right, it's for a worthy cause
Go on Cynthia

Keep sayin' starfish and Coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
A side order of ham

If you set your mind free baby
Maybe you'll understand
Starfish and Coffee
Maple syrup and jam, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
