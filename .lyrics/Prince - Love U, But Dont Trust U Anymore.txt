Rolling...
I could tell from the moment you walked in the room
That it wasn't your dress you had on
That wasn't your perfume
And what happened 2 the ring that I gave U?
What am I 2 assume?
I love U, but I don't trust you anymore

U could tell from the moment you looked in my eyes
That I could see right through U
U must apologize
I've always given you the best in life
Even in the wrong, it was right
I know you trust me, but you don't love me anymore, no no

I remember meeting you here in the good ol' days
I would never pick the flower of my favorite prot'g'
Maybe if I would have
Then you would not treat me this way
U tricked me, but you will not anymore, no no
I love U, but I don't trust you anymore
