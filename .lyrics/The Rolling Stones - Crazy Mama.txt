Well, you're crazy, Mama
With your ball and chain
And your sawn off shotgun
Your blown out brains, yeah

You can scandalize me
Scorn my name
You can steal my money
And that don't mean a doggone thing

'Cause if you really think you can push it
I'm going to bust your knees with a bullet, woo
You're crazy mama, ah yeah

Well, your old time religion
Is just a superstition
You going to pay high prices
For your sacrifices, ah yeah

Now, your blood and thunder
Sure can't faze me none
If you're going to keep on coming
I'm gonna take it all head on

Ah, if you don't believe I'm going to do it
Just wait till you get hit by that bullet, woo

Crazy Mama, ah yeah
Now come 'round here, get your boy, woo

Ah, don't think I ain't thought about it
It sure makes my shackles rise
And cold blooded murder
Make me want to draw the line, woo, yeah

Well, you're crazy, Mama
With your ball and chain
You're plain psychotic, woo
Plain insane, yeah

If you don't think I'm gonna do it
Yeah, just wait for the thud of the bullet, woo
Crazy Mama, ah yeah
Ah, you're crazy Mama, yeah
Ah, you're crazy Mama, yeah
Crazy Mama, woo
