I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy
Oh, no, oh
I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot the deputy
Ooh, ooh, ooh 

Yeah, all around in my hometown
They're trying to track me down, yeah
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy, for the life of a deputy
But I say
Oh, now, now, oh

I shot the sheriff, shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self defense
Oh no, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
I said, I shot the sheriff, oh lord
And they say it, oh now, is a capital offense, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hear this

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time I plant a seed
He said, "Kill it before it grows"
He said, "Kill them before they grow"
And so, and so
Read it in the news

I shot the sheriff, oh lord
But I swear it was in self defense
Where was the deputy?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I say I shot the sheriff 
But I swear it was in self defense, yeah
Oooh ooh

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah
All of a sudden I saw Sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot, I shot him down
And I say
If I am guilty I will pay

I shot the sheriff, but I say, but I didn't shoot the deputy
I didn't shoot no deputy, no
Ooh, no, oh
I shot the sheriff
I grieve
But I didn't shoot the deputy
Oh
Ooo, ooo, ooh
Yeah

Reflexes had the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket a-go a well
One day the bottom of-a drop out
One day the bottom of-a drop out
I say
I, I, I, I shot the sheriff, lord I didn't shot the deputy, no
Yeah, I, I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy, yeah
