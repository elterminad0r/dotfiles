I got the feeling that you're holding back on me
Keeping your distance taking it slow
Watching and waiting to see

Am I for real, you wanna know
What's the deal?
Where do we go from here?

Ask me no question and I won't lie
No guarantees, just a promise to try
Trust the vibe is all that we can do

Let your love come through
Love come through to you
Let your love come through
Going through to you

No time for mind games
It's right down to the vibe
It's all about hate, passion and fire
I am all for real, I'm letting you know
Love's the deal so just let go and feel

Don't ask me no question 'cause I don't wanna lie
No guarantees, all I do is promise to try
Trust the vibe is all that we can do

Let your love come through
Love come through to you
Let your love come through
Coming through to you
Let your love come through
Let your love come in to me

Ask me no question and I won't lie
No guarantees, all I do is promise to try
Trust the vibe is all that we can do
Love come through to you
Let your love come through
Going through to you

Love come through to you
Let your love come through
Love come through to you
Let your love come through
Going through to you
