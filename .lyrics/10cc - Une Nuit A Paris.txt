Part One: One Night in Paris

Mme. Bezier:
Bonjour, monsieur
Paris really welcomes you
It's the best room in the house (she lied)
It's forty francs a night, all right?

Touriste:
It's crazy, it isn't worth a centime
I'll take it!

Mme. Bezier:
Merci, Monsieur

Offstage Chorus:
Rouged lips in the gaslight
A great view of the hall
That's the way the croissant crumbles after all

Narrator:
Paris is only one step away
Les girls are out on bail
Tres bien, there's love for sale

Coquette:
Oh my cheri, wish you were mine
And I'll show you a wonderful time
For the price of a cheap champagne
I'll show it you once again

Voice of the Streets:
One night in Paris
Is like a year in any other place
One night in Paris
Will wipe the smile off your pretty face
One girl in Paris
Is like loving every woman
One night in Paris
One night in Paris
One night in Paris
May be your last!


Part Two: The Same Night In Paris

Hustlers (1 to 5):
Is he gonna buy?

1.Offstage:

Hustlers:

2.Offstage:

3.Offstage:

Hustlers:

5.Offstage:
Le connoisseur, want something different?

Hustlers:
Or is he gonna fall in love
The all American way?

Everyone:
Oh you know you ain't no Casanova
You can't even do the bossa Nova
Or the tango or the samba!

Chinese Tarts:
Though you are so very charming
No you ain't no Casanova

Hustlers:
Is he gonna buy? (Is he gonna buy?)
Is he gonna pay? (Is he gonna pay?)
Or is he gonna fall in love
The all American way?

Is he gonna buy? (Is he gonna buy?)
Is he gonna pay? (Is he gonna pay?)
Or is he gonna fall in love
The all American way?

Sometimes I think he will
But then again...

Voices of the Streets:
One night in Paris
Is like a year in any other place!
One night in Paris
Will wipe the smile off your pretty face!
Try a girl in Paris
But try one of mine
Each night in Paris
Each night in Paris
Each night in Paris
Each night in Paris
May be your last!


Part Three: Later The Same Night In Paris

Coquette's Girls:
Forty-two, quarante-deux
Rue de Saint Jacques
All our girls are how you say
Good in the sack

Coquette:
I was a stripper
On the Champs-Élysées
He was a gendarme
In the gendarmerie

Girls:
Going ooh la la la
Ooh la la la la

Coquette:
He was a pimp
In a black beret
But he was an artiste
In his own way

Girls:
Ooh la la la
Ooh la la la la

Coquette:
When they raided my club that night (that night)
They ruined my act with the leather umbrella
The chief of police got a fright
He was up in my boudoir with some other fella, whoa

Club Clientele:
It's only routine
But I got this feeling
It ain't good for business

Narrator:
Then the floor cleared
A woman screamed to herself

Henri's Lover:
Henri, though you're not the toast of Paris
I love you
Although you bed and beat me
Henri, leave it alone
For the gendarme's just doing his job

Narrator:
Paris is only one step away

Murder is only one step away

Everyone:
Notre Dame is ringing her bells
Another gendarme has gone to Hell
Notre Dame is ringing her bells
Another gendarme has gone to Hell
To Hell, to Hell...

Whole Cast:
One night in Paris
Is like a year in any other place
One night in Paris
Will wipe the smile off your pretty face
One girl in Paris
Is like loving every woman
This night in Paris
This night in Paris
This night in Paris
This night in Paris
May be your last!
