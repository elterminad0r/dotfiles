She hung them on the wall
The roaches refused to crawl

She threw them on the roof
The roof turned bullet proof

She threw them In the sink
The sink began to stink
She flung them on the door the door went through the floor

She hung them in the air
The air said this ain't fair
She hung them in the sun
The sun began to run
She threw them on the line
The line it started to cryin'
She threw them in the yard
The yard it cried oh Lord
She threw them in the sink
The sink began to stink
She threw them on the wall
The roaches refused to crawl
She threw them in the air
The air said this ain't fair
She threw them on the fence
The cats ain't been back since
