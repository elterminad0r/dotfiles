Like dat? We can do this all night.

I know you got a young man
U don't care about me
He's darker than quicksand
He's taller than a tree
What you need is some real lovin'
'Stead of these young ass fools
I got the butter 4 u're muffin
Just need the keys 2 the room

Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now

We could freeze in London
U could hear me sing (hear me sing)
And if you wanna make love then
U got 2 wear my ring (C'mon)
'Cause I don't want no mistress
I'd much rather be bound
Let's find a Preacher
So we can get down, down, down

Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (Come on)

Ha. U and u're girlfriend, y'all 2 of a kind
Just runnin' these knuckleheads
3 and 4 at a time
Both of U's want babies
But u're still actin' wild
The first rule in makin' one
U can't be no child
'Stead of hittin' that remy (hittin' that remy)
Why don't y'all hit the door (hit the door)
I'll book us on the Red Eye, we'll be good 2 go (good 2 go)
And if every life has got a reason, U can be mine
Perfume in the bath darlin'
Champagne, while we dine

Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on)
Come on baby (shake it, shake it baby)
Come on shake it now (Oh - Come on)

Come on Baby
Yeah. Come on.

20 days in London
U ain't give me no love
Could it be another brother man
That U're thinkin' of?
Or could it be u're girlfriend?
Who never, ever been straight
When I ask U R U hungry... (hungry)
U say you already ate.
Now. U can play me if you wanna
But you better let me know (let me know baby)
I don't need 2 play the good licks if there ain't gonna be no show
I'm better off sleepin' with my guitar
If you ain't gonna sing
Strapped 2 the body... makin' love 2 the strings.

Oh. Oh, oh, oh
Yeah Baby
Oh. Oh, oh, oh
Come on baby. Come on shake it now. (4x)

Gimme, gimme, gimme good lovin'
'Stead of talkin' 'bout me man (come on)
If we ain't gonna make love
Can't do nothin' 4 me, 4 me
Gimme, gimme, gimme good lovin'
Can't do nothin' 4 me baby.

Come on baby, come on shake it now (3x)
Come on baby, I got the butter 4 u're muffin
