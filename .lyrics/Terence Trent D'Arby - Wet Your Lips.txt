Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
You are beautiful to me
Wet your lips and let's do a thing
With a view to make your spirit sing
I have come to be your man
In a strange and hostile land
So wet your lips
And let's fall in love
And stay with me

Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
You are blood and wine to me
Wet you lips
And let's do a turn
With a view to make your body burn
I'll rebuild the scenery
Into garden greenery
So wet your lips
And let's fall in love
And stay with me

Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
You're the molecular soul of me
Wet your lips
And let's dip your wings
Into shapes of many things
I have come to bring new life
And to help you squeeze it from your slice
So wet your lips
And let's fall in love
And stay with me

I will feed you like a bird
From the mouth of my dying words
So wet your lips
And let's fall in love

Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
Wet your lips
And let's fall in love
Stay...

Girl you take me higher
Yeah you take me deeper
Girl you take me higher
