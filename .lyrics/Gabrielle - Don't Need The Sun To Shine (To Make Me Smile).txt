Oh-oh-oh

It's been a while,
But your smile,
Always brightens up my day,
I guess you know,
Because it shows,
You can see it on my face,
It's like you've put a spell on me,
Feels like you've captured me,
And baby,
This is how I feel...

Oh-oh-oh,

Don't need the sun to shine,
To make me smile,
Don't care if it's dark outside,
'Cause I got you,
And though the rain may fall,
No I won't care at all,
'Cause baby,
I know that I got you.

Every day,
There's a change,
You bring out the best in me,
My inner soul,
Is what you know,
That is how you speak to me,
You seem to understand,
You know just who I am,
And baby,
This is how I feel...

Oh-oh-oh,

Don't need the sun to shine,
To make me smile (oh yeah),
Don't care if it's dark outside,
'Cause I got you,
And though the rain may fall,
No I won't care at all,
'Cause baby,
I know that I got you.

Don't need a rocket man,
To help me touch the sky,
I don't need to fly a plane,
To get this high,
Don't need to hitch a ride,
When I could run a million miles,
Yes I would,
Just to see you smile...

(Don't need the sun to shine,
To make me smile)
Don't care if it's dark outside,
'Cause I got you (baby I got you),
And though the rain may fall (though the rain may fall)
I won't care at all (I won't care at all)
'Cause baby,
I know that I got you (I got you, I got you, yeah)

Don't need the sun to shine,
To make me smile (to make me smile),
Don't care if it's dark outside,
'Cause I got you (baby I got you),
And though the rain may fall (though the rain may fall),
No I won't care at all (I won't care at all)
'Cause baby,
I know that I got you (I got you, hey)

(Don't need the sun to shine to make me smile)
I got you baby, and it feels right,
You got me feelin' so good, so high
(Don't care if it's dark outside, 'cause I got you)
Yeah I can touch the sky
(And though the rain may fall)
I got you baby and it feels right,
You got me, got me feelin' good, so good
(Fades)
