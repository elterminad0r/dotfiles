Could you be loved
And be loved
Could you be loved
And be loved

Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya, oh no!
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell if what you're thinkin' isn't right
Love would never leave us alone
A-in the darkness there must come out to light

Could you be loved
And be loved
A-could you be loved, whoa yeah
And be loved

The road of life is rocky
And you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers
Someone else is judging you
Love your brother-man

(Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
(Could you be, could you be loved?)
(Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
(Could you be, could you be loved?)

Don't let them change ya, oh
Or even rearrange ya
Oh, no!
We've got a life to live
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
They say, only, only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive, eh

Could you be loved
And be loved
A-could you be loved, whoa yeah
And be loved

(Never miss your water, until your well runs dry
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied)

Say something! (Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
(Could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something! Say something!
(Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something!
Say something! Say something! Say something!
Say something! Say something! (Could you be loved?)
Say something! Say something! Reggae, reggae!
Say something! Rockers, rockers!
Say something! Reggae, reggae!
Say something! Rockers, rockers!
Say something! (Could you be loved?)
Say something! Uh!
Say something! Come on!
Say something! (Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something! (Could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something! (Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something!
Say something..
