Lonely tonight, lonely tonight, lonely tonight, lonely tonight
Lonely tonight, lonely tonight, lonely tonight, lonely tonight

We're enchanted, struck by lightning
What can we do when the feeling's so exciting?
We just ran into each other
Now we can't refuse, 'cause the night is so inviting
You sure took me by surprise, I ain't fooling

Everything was synchronized in a movement
When I met you, I knew there was a reason
Every moment that we've shared guarantees it

We... we won't be lonely tonight
Must be miles ago since we first said "hello"
We. we won't let us out of our sights
Passion has to grow, darling because we know
Riding our tide, luck is with us
No risk to take, when we've got so much to give us
Fate's on our side and it's our moment
We're getting warm, 'cause we give each other shivers

Yeah, let's keep the fire alight
Nothing can go wrong, we're together for now on
Oh, all the love we excite
Loneliness has gone, did it take us so long
Can't remember life without your music
Oh, there never was a doubt, don't we prove it?
You sure took me by surprise, I ain't fooling
Everything is synchronized in a movement

We're enchanted, stuck by lightning
What can we do when the feeling's so exciting?
We just ran into each other
Now we can't refuse, 'cause the night is so inviting

We won't be lonely tonight
Must be miles ago since we first said "hello"
We won't let us out of our sights
Passion has to grow, darling because we know
Yeah, let's keep the fire alight
Nothing can go wrong, we're together for now on
Oh, all the love we excite
Loneliness has gone, did it take us so long...
