Woah, they say the bigger the headache, the bigger the pill, baby
Call me the big pill, Dr. Funkenstein
The disco fiend with the monster sound
The grove ghoul with the bump transplant

Hip bone connected to my thigh bone
My thigh bone connected to my leg bone
My leg bone connected to my ankle bone
I get so hung up on bones
Dr. Funkenstein here
Preoccupied and dedicated to the preservation of the motion of hips

We love to funk you, Funkenstein, your funk is the best
(Talk!)
Take my body, give it the mind, to funk with the rest
(Kiss me on my ego)
Hit me with the one and then, if you like, hit me again
We love to Funkastein
(O-o-o-over)

Dr. Funkenstein, king of the funk, yeah
Swift lippin', ego trippin' and body snatchin'
I'll blow your mind
Comin' to you directly from the mother ship
Pulling up the last leg of the P funk
Yeah!

Well, all right!
Dr. Funkenstein, yeah
Don't funk with your mind

We love to funk you, Funkenstein, your funk is the best
(Let me hear it for me)
Take my body, give it the mind, to funk with the rest
(Ha)
Hit me with the one and then, if you like, hit me again
(All right)
We love to Funkastein

Microbiologically speaking, when I start churnin', burnin' and turnin'
I'll make your atoms move so fast, expandin' your molecules
Causing a friction fire, burnin' you on your neutron
Causing you to scream, "Hit me in the proton", baby

(I don't know what I'm talking about)
Hit me with the one and then, if you like hit me again
We love you, Funkenstein
(Oh yeah, let's do it one more time)
O-o-o-over
Hoo wee
(You're really out of sight)
I hope you all got your sunglasses on out there

Ho!
What is that, it's really gonna blow your mind
(Nonsense)

We love to funk you, Funkenstein, your funk is the best
(Talk!)
Take my body, give it the mind to funk with the rest
(Kiss me on my ego)
Hit me with the one and then, if you like, hit me again
We love to Funkastein

We love to funk you, Funkenstein, your funk is the best
(O-o-o-over)
Take my body, give it the mind to funk with the rest
Hit me with the one and then, if you like, hit me again
We love to Funkastein

Ain't nothing but a party, baby
Swift lippin' and ego trippin' and body snatchin'
(Dr. Funkenstein, you are really out of sight)
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill, they call me the big pill

Hit me with the one and then, if you like, hit me again
We love to, Funkastein
(Yeah, hit me one time, one time)
(Hey man, you make me feel so bad)

We love to funk you, Funkenstein, your funk is the best
(It is so funky around here)
Take my body, give it the mind to funk with the rest
(I'm just funkin' and jumpin')
Hit me with the one and then, if you like, hit me again
We love to Funkastein
(Yeah, we love you Dr. Funkenstein, yeah)

We love to funk you, Funkenstein, your funk is the best
Take my body, give it the mind
To funk with the rest
(Yeah, take it, take it. Take it.)
Hit me with the one and then, if you like, hit me again
We love to Funkastein
