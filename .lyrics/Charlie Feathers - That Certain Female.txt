Well
Ah huh-uh-uh-huh, oooow!

Yeah!

Well I'm'a just'a single fella
With a lot on my mind
And I'm'a lookin' for me a woman
But she's mighty hard ta'find

Oh'I asked my country cousin
Check the hottest spots in town
Oh that little-bitty woman
Well she just ain't around

Ooww! Hey, hey, ho!

Oh I'm lookin'
Lookin'
Searchin' high an'low
Don't wanna miss'a spot
Keep it on the go

Waitin'
Watchin'
This woman's got'ta show

I need this little bitty woman
How much you'll never know

Ooooooww!

Yes!
Do it!
Do it twice!
Woo!

Well I'm'a just'a single fella
With a lot on my mind

I said I'm lookin' for me a woman
She's mighty hard ta' find
I asked my country cousin
Where's she hangin' out

Lost this little bitty woman, she's just outta sight

Oh ho ho Ho!

Oh I'm lookin'
Lookin'
Checkin' high an'low
Don't wanna miss'a spot
Keep it on the go

Waitin'
Watchin'
That woman, she's gonna show

I need this little bitty woman
How much you'll ever know

Ooh... Now

I just need a simple
Where she's hanging out
I promise'ta make it worth your while
If you mark her out
Name your price and make it fast
Waited much too long
Got that woman on the mind
I'm gonna bring'er home

Oh yeah!

Oh I'm lookin'
Lookin'
Searchin' high an'low
OW!
Don't wanna miss'a spot
Keep it on the goooo

Waitin'
Watchin'
This woman, she gonna show

I need this little bitty woman
How much you'll ever know

Baby, I need you
How much you'll never know

Lord, I need this little bitty woman
How much you'll never know!

Owww!
