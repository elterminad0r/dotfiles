Here I am,
Waiting for a sign,
I never seem to know,
If you want me in your life,

Where do I stand,
I just don't know,
I never feel I know you,
'Cause you blow hot and you blow cold,

It seems I've grown attached,
Though we're not the perfect match,
I just can't explain,

Should I stay, should I go,
Could I ever really stand to let go,
Can you not find the right words to say,
That maybe I'm getting in your way,

I feel your warmth,
Got me wanting more,
You've left the door half open,
I'm in two minds to explore,

But then again,
Am I being honest,
Being truthful to myself,
Can I see my life without you,
Could I be with someone else,

It seems I've grown attached,
Though we're not the perfect match,
I just can't explain,
Oh no,

Should I stay, should I go,
Could I ever really stand to let you go,
Can you not find the right words to say,
That maybe I'm getting in your way,
Should I stay, should I go,
I really think it's time that you should let me know,
Can you not find the right words to say,
That maybe I'm getting in your way

It seems I've grown attached,
Though we're not the perfect match,
I just can't explain,
Oh no,

Should I stay, should I go,
Could I ever really stand to let you go,
Can you not find the right words to say,
That maybe I'm getting in your way,
Should I stay, should I go,
I really think it's time that you should let me know,
Can you not find the right words to say,
That maybe I'm getting in your way

Should I stay, should I go,
Could I ever stand to let you go,
Can you not find the right words to say,
That maybe I'm getting in your way,

Should I stay, should I go,
I think it's time you let me know,
Can you not find the right words to say,
That maybe I'm getting in your way
