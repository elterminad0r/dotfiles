When I find you waiting hours; oh,
You're there to save my life for our obvious goal
We've got a headstart for happiness
For our part, guess we must be blessed
For this feeling to be so strong
Tell me is that so wrong?
The space betweeen us for days has been so far;
I've spent a lonely week
Now I wanna be where you are
We've got a headstart for happiness, for our part
Guess we must be kissed by this force I feel inside
Now I'm not gonna hide.

All the roads that lead to struggles
Bring you back to where you need
Some reassurance in your own depth,
Only you can see, but let others feel
Peace in my mind I'm so happy to find
As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you.

You'll find it can happen
You'll find you've got the strength
You can move a mountain
You just need the confidence

In yourself and all you've got to take this world
And shake it up
Let no one say they're better than you
You must believe you've got the power

To rise above the lies
'Cause what we're dealing here with today is a love thing
Right here, right now
Now listen

When I find you waiting hours, oh
It's my heart, not my head that takes control
And you've got to lead where your heart says go
And this hope that it turns out so
And that's all that you can hope for
Can you expect much more?

Naive and wise with no sense of time
As I set my clock with a heart beat, tick tock
Violent and mild - common sense says I'm wild
With this mixed up fury, crazy beauty
It's healthy to find all these feelings inside
As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you.
