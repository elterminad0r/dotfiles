'Uckin' with my shi'
There's too many mutha'uckas
'Uckin' with my shi' ('uckin' with my shi')
Too many mutha'uckas
'Uckin' with my shi' (with my shi')
How many mutha'uckas?
Too many to count, mutha'uckas

Mutha'uckas at the bank trying to play me
An amount from my account goes out on A/P (on A/P)
Yeah, you know me
Mutha'ucka charge a two buck transaction fee
Makes my payment short, my rent comes back to me
Minus a twenty-five dollar penalty
So you fee'd me 'cause of your mutha'uckin' fee!

Said, "We're all mutha'uckas
And we're 'uckin' with your shi'," come on!

Too many mutha'uckas

With my balance shi'!

Too many to count, mutha'uckas!

The mutha'ucka runs a racist 'uckin' grocery
The mutha'ucka won't sell an apple to a Kiwi
The shi' fight's gonna get vicious and malicious
Cut the cra' ...'sh'...'ause I need my red delicious
Tells me as a Kiwi that my money isn't valid
Gonna dice the mutha'ucka like a mutha'uckin' fruit salad
