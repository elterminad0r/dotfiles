I was laughing
Playing in the streets
I was unknowing
I didn't know my fate

Playing
The game of love
But never really showing
I thought that love would wait

I was a young man
And I was sure to go astray
You walked right into my life and told me
"Love would find a way"

Gotta keep on growing
Keep on growing
Keep on growing

I was standing
Looking in the face
Of one who loved me
Feeling so ashamed

Hoping
Praying, Lord
That she could understand me
But I didn't know her name

She took my hand in hers
And then told me I was wrong
She said, "You're gonna be alright, boy
Whoa, just as long..."

Gotta keep on growing
Keep on growing
Keep on growing
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby

Baby
Someday, maybe
Who knows where or when, girl
Just you wait and see

We'll be walking
Together hand in hand, along forever
Woman just you and me.

Timeâ€™s gonna change us, Lord
And I know it's true
Our love's gonna keep on glowing
And growing is all we gotta do, yeah, yeah

Keep on growing
Keep on going
Keep on flowing
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Keep on flowing
Keep on growing
Keep on going
