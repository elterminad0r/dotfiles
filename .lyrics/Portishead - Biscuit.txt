I'm lost, exposed
Stranger things will come your way
It's just I'm scared
Got hurt a long time ago
Can't make myself heard
No matter how hard I scream

Oh sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

Fully fed yet I still hunger
Torn inside
Haunted I tell myself yet I still wander
Down, inside
It's tearing me apart

Oh sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

(I'll never fall in love again
It's all over now)

At last, relief
A mother's son has left me sheer
The shores I seek
Are crimson tastes divine
Can't make myself heard
No matter how hard I scream

Oh sensation
Sin, slave of sensation

(I'll never fall in love again
It's all over now)
