Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me crawling
Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me trying
Can't you hear me when I call
I'm a long way from sight
Tonight tonight
It's a long long night
Tonight tonight
It's a long long night
Can't you see me baby fly
Can't you see me falling
Can't you hear me when I call
Can't you see me fall
Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me mama call
Tonight tonight
It's a long long night
Tonight tonight
It's a long long night
Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me crawling
Can't you hear me when I call
Can't you see me fall
Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me mama call
Me hielo en la habitación
No tengo calefacción
Can't you get no satisfaction
So me bajo pa la calle
It's a long long night
Can't you hear me mama call
Can't you hear me crawling
Can't you hear me call
Can't you hear me falling
Can't you hear me fall
I'm a long way from home...
