This isn't living now
A thing my father said to me
And get a haircut, boy
If you want a chance in respectable society
Why did you stop writing?
I knew you had some trouble, son
But you should know by now
That my number doesn't change
Because my dirty deed is done

All I need from you
And that's all
Regardless of whatever you do
And that is that you understand
That I'll never turn my back on you

How are your wife and child?
I'm sure your little girl has grown
And give them a kiss and a smile
That's what my daddy said
In a letter very long
What kind of man would I be?
If I left you in despair (and then he wrote)
And I miss your mother, son
'Cause if she were still alive
She'd tell you too
You should cut your hair

All I need from you
And that's all
Regardless of whatever you do
And that is that you realise
That I'll never turn my back on you

Whatever you do just try to get through to me
Remember the time we got drunk on wine by the sea
And I laughed when you tried to stagger home by yourself
You were stubborn then and you are still stubborn now

All I need from you
And that's all
Regardless of whatever you do
And that is that you understand
That I'll never turn my back on you
