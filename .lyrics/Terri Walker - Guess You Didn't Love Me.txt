(Come on) Uh-uh
(Ha-ha) Uh, well
Baby Dove in the mix, what
(What's up) Yeah, come on
(Let me know what's goin' down, ma)
I guess you didn't love me (Ha-ha)
I just guess you didn't (Come on)

Tell me, well, u mean to corner me that way
Hope not
Maybe it was mistake, stressed out
And you need to take a break from this relationship

But I, you said I was your everything, your dime
Why can't you just make up your mind
But I don't feel like wonderin' this time
Are you gonna stay with me, boy

Do you wanna give up
Are you gonna let my love go
Baby, think it over
Someone else will have my heart

So do you really want that
If you do then
I guess you didn't love me
Love me at all

Could you take seein' me with someone else
Would you be mad at yourself
Would you regret the decision you made
And wanna come back to me

So bad, too bad, it'll be too late
Separation's somethin' you create
Bein' without you is somethin' I would hate
But when it's over it's over

Do you wanna give up
Are you gonna let my love go
Baby, think it over
Someone else will have my heart

So do you really want that
If you do then
I guess you didn't love me
Love me at all



Do you wanna give up
Are you gonna let my love go
Baby, think it over
Someone else will have my heart

So do you really want that
If you do then
I guess you didn't love me
Love me at all

Come on, ma, what the deal, what time is it
I got the engine runnin' you ready to ride wit' it
You talkin' low voice crackin' the crisis
And somethin' in your eyes in indecisive
I'm scramblin' for clues tryin' to find where your
Mind is
Conversation filled with uncomfortable silence
I'm playin' good deed tryin' to tackle the problems
Wonderin' how the hell you got into office
Wow, what part of the game is this
You wanna feel, makin' rules, what play is this
I thought that we was whole team, but you're Sushi Uni
And now you got the whole game lookin' different to me
But get your focus, baby girl, and just listen to me
I don't want it if you don't wanna give it to me
Bein' the boss I am, I don't force my hand
Yeah, I'm hurt, but you don't understand how sure I am

Do you wanna give up
Are you gonna let my love go
Baby, think it over
Someone else will have my heart

So do you really want that
If you do then
I guess you didn't love me
Love me at all

Do you wanna give up
Are you gonna let my love go
Baby, think it over
Someone else will have my heart

So do you really want that
If you do then
I guess you didn't love me
Love me at all
