I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
Vampire
I am a vampire
I have lost my fangs

I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I have lost my fangs

So I'm sad and I feel lonely
So I cry and I'm very angry
And I eat some garlic
So I'm no more satanic
Yeah yeah

I am a vampire and I'm looking in the city
But the pretty girls don't look at me
Don't look at me
'Cause I don't have my fangs
'Cause I have lost my fangs

I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I have lost my mouth organ
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I have lost my mouth organ

So I get bored and I shout
So I eat pop corn and I put on weight
And I sing but my voice is breaking
And I want to play the guitar
But my guitar is out of tune
I am a vampire and I'm walking in the city
But the musicals don't play with me
Don't play with me

'Cause I don't have my mouth organ
'Cause I have lost my mouth organ
