Get up 'outta' your rockin' chair grandma!
Or rather would you care to dance grandmother?

Hey you! Give up to the ghost
That's haunting you now
Shout it out
Don't let it stay inside
And eat you alive
Make up your mind
Don't you want to stay
This side of the line
I can assure you
When you're my age
You'll learn
From all you've left behind

(You've got to)
Dance little sister
Don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow
I don't wanna hear you're late
Dance little sister
Don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow
Don't give up your stay

Say now share the weight
And lay your cross down
And let the long reaching arm
Of hope bring you around
It ain't easy but giving up
Is the easy thing to do
Time is on your side
Would you just watch the clock
And let it tick for you

(You've got to)
Dance little sister
Don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow
I don't wanna hear you're late
Dance little sister
Don't give up today
Hang on till tomorrow
Don't give up your stay
