You're probably wondering why I'm here
And so am I, so am I
Just as much as you wonder 'bout me bein' in this place, yeah
That's just how much I marvel at the lameness on your face

You rise each day the same old way
And join your friends out on the street
Spray your hair and think you're neat
I think your life is incomplete
But maybe that's not for me to say
They only pay me here to play

I wanna hear Caravan with a drum solo

You're probably wondering why I'm here
And so am I, so am I
Just as much as you wonder 'bout me starin' back at you, yeah
That's just how much I question the corny things you do

You paint your face and then you chase
To meet the gang where the action is
Stomp all night and drink your fizz
Roll your car and say "Gee whiz!"
You tore a big hole in your convertible top
What will you tell your Mom and Pop?

"Mom, I tore a big hole in the convertible."

You're probably wondering why I'm here
And so am I, so am I
Just as much as you wonder if I mean just what I say, yeah
That's just how much I question the social games you play

You told your Mom you're stoked on Tom
And went for a cruise in Freddie's car
Tommy's asking where you are
You boogied all night in a cheesy bar
Plastic boots and plastic hat
And you think you know where it's at?
Yeah!

You're probably wondering why I'm here
Not that it makes a heck of a lot of a difference to ya
