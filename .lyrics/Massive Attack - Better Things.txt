Don't drag me down just because you're down
And just 'cause you're blue don't make me, too
Though you found you need more than me
Don't talk to me about being free

That's freedom without love,
Magic without love, magic without love
Hear me say, better things will surely come my way
Hear me say, better things will surely come my way

You say that the magic's gone, well, I'm not a magician
You say the spark's gone, well, get an electrician
And save your lie about needing to be free
Oh, that's bullshit, baby, you just want rid of me

Your freedom without love,
Magic without love, magic without love, yeah
Hear me say, better things will surely come my way
Hear me say, better things will surely come my way
