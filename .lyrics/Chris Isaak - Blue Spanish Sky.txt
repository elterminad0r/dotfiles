It's a big, blue Spanish sky
Lay on my back and watch clouds roll by
I've got the time to wonder why
She left me

It's a slow, sad Spanish song
I knew the words but I sang them wrong
The one I love has left and gone
Without me

Now she's gone
How the world has changed
Watchin a blue sky
Thinkin of rain

It's a slow, sad Spanish song
I knew the words but I sang them wrong
The one that I love has left and gone
Without me

It's a big, blue Spanish sky
I lay on my back and watch clouds roll by
I only wish I could make you cry
Like I do

Like I do
Like I do
