Dream
Beyond dreams
Beyond life
You will find
Your

Song
Before sound
To be found
Close your eyes
And

Rise
Higher still
Endless thrill
To the land
Of

Love
Beyond love
Come alive
Angel Eye
Forever watching you and I

You are the night
You are the ocean
You are the light behind a cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world where time is not allowed

There's no such thing as competition
To find our way we lose control
Remember love's our only mission
This is a journey of the soul

The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
Your home's a promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams
