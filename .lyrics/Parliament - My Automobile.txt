You don't have to walk home my dear
You don't have to walk home my love
If you'll be nice to me
Then I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile

All that I want is just a little kiss
All that I want is a teeny weeny hug
If you'll be nice to me
Then I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile

Sit just a little bit closer my dear
Sit just a little bit closer my love
If you'll be nice to me
Then I'll be good to you
And we'll botjupe home in my automobile

What? No kisses my dear
What? No huggin' my love
If you don't want to talk
You're gonna have to get out and walk
And I'll ride home in my automobile
