We know what you're going through
We've been there before
And you're gonna make it, just listen

They drop us off at night
We grew up here, this is all we know
But then my chance arrives
There is no telling how far we'll go

You see, I had this dream
That I pursued to change the world
Like superheroes do

And if I concentrate and keep control
And I'm just getting started
Pay attention 'cause

I'm on a roll
I'm hitting triple sevens
Baby, you should bet on me

I'm on a roll
Haters, what's up? What's happening?
Keep your eyes set on me

This is my chance to try
Even though it seems like no one's there
But if I get this right
They'll get to see how much I care

There is no time to waste
But when can you?
I have no cape
I think my clothes would do

So you should brace yourself
I'm about to go
No need to try 'cause

I'm on a roll
I'm hitting triple sevens
Baby, you should bet on me

I'm on a roll
Haters, what's up? What's happening?
Keep your eyes set on me

Now get your hands up high
Get your hands up high
Now get your hands up high
Get your hands up high

Now get your hands up high
Get your hands up high
Now get your hands up high
Get your hands up high

I'm on a roll
I'm hitting triple sevens
Baby, you should bet on me

I'm on a roll
Haters, what's up? What's happening?
Keep your eyes set on me

Now get your hands up high
Get your hands up high
Now get your hands up high
Get your hands up high

Now get your hands up high
Get your hands up high
Now get your hands up high
Get your hands up high
