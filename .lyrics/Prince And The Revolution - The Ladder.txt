Once upon a time in the land of Sinaplenty
There lived a king who didn't deserve to be
He knew not where he came from
Nor where he was going
He never once said thank you, never please

Now this king, he had a subject named Electra
Who loved him with a passion, uncontested
For him, each day she had a smile
But it didn't matter
The king was looking for the ladder

Everybody's looking for the ladder
Everybody wants salvation of the soul
The steps you take are no easy road
But the reward is great for those who want to go

A feeling of self-worth will caress you
(Everybody's looking for the answers)
The size of the whole wide world will decrease
(how the story started and how it will end
The love of God's creation will undress you
And time spent alone my friend, will cease

Everybody's looking 4 the answers
How the story started and how it will end
What's the use in half a story, half a dream
You have to climb all the steps in between
Yeah, we ride

Everybody's looking for the ladder
Everybody wants salvation of the soul
The steps you take are no easy road (the steps you take are no easy road)
(It's not that easy)
But the reward is great
4 those who want 2 go (I do)

Everybody... everybody's looking for the answers
(Everybody's looking for the answers)
Everybody wants to know how the story (How the story started)
Started and how it will end (started and how it will end)
What's the use in half a story? (What's the use in half a story)
Half a dream? (Half of a dream?)
U, U gotta climb, U gotta climb (U have 2 climb all)
All of the steps in between (the steps in between)

(Everybody's looking 4 the ladder)
Everybody, everybody's looking 4 that ladder
(Everybody wants salvation of the soul)
Everybody wants salvation of the soul
(Salvation)
(The steps you take are no easy road)
The steps you take are no easy road, that's for sure
But the reward is great (the reward is great)
For those who want to go, (4 those who want 2 go)
Those who want to go

(Everybody's looking 4 the answers)
Everybody, everybody wants an answer
(How the story started)
Anyone who know how the story started
How it will end (how it will end)
Will it be lonely in the world (What's the use in half a story)
What's the use? (half of a dream)
(Have to climb all the steps in between)
