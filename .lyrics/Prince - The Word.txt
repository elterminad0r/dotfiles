(Let's go)

What is this new exaltation
That I just can't explain?
What r these new inspirations
That I can't get outta my brain?
How am I gonna sleep with this feeling
Rushing all through my veins?
Get up, come on let's do something
Don't you wanna go get saved?

The night is calling U 2 act
Act upon every urge
U can't get no satisfaction
If you ain't got the courage
I don't know what U're afraid of
I don't know what U've heard
Get up, come on let's do something
Don't you wanna know the word?

Who's gonna save us when them spiders get next 2 U?
Spinning their sticky webs around what you do?
(We gotta) safeguard against forked tongue and the treachery of the wicked 1
Get up, come on let's do something

Don't matter how far you have 2
The truth has got 2 be told
Don't matter how shiny your lips
They'll never be streets of gold
They might try 2 get us crazy
'Cause they don't know what I've heard
We got this new exaltation
I'm talking about the word

(Next 2 U, next 2 U)
(What you do, yeah)
(Forked tongue)
(Wicked 1)

Get up, come on let's do something
No reason 2 feel this pain
Get up, come on let's do something
Come on, go, let's get saved
{Repeat}

Get up, come on let's do something {x4}
Don't you wanna hear the word?
