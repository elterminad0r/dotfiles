I decline to walk the line 
They tell me that I'm lazy 
Worldly wise, I realize 
That everybody's crazy 
A woman's voice reminds me 
To serve and not to speak 
Am I myself or just another freak 

You know there's fire in the hole 
And nothin' left to burn 
I'd love to run out now 
There's no way left to turn, no, no 

With a cough, I shake it off 
And work around my yellow stripe 
Should I hide or eat my pride 
Or wait until it's good and ripe 
My life is boiling over 
It's happened once before 
I wish someone would open up the door 

Don't you know there's fire in the hole 
And nothin' left to burn 
I'd love to run out now 
There's no way left to turn

Don't you know there's fire in the hole 
And nothin' left to burn 
I'd love to run out now 
There's no way left to turn

Yeah, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
