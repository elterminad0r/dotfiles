Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it!

If you look around
The whole world's coming together now, baby
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it!

Feel it in the air
The wind is taking it everywhere, yeah
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it!

All the colors of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes it's alright, take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the men
Who is hatin' his brother when hate won't do, whooh
'Cause we're all the same
Yes the blood inside of me is inside of you

Now tell me!
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it!
Now tell me!
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it!
Yeah, yeah, uuh

Sing aloud because we want to make a crowd
Touch a hand a sing
A song so pure salvation rings

Tell me!
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it!
Yeah, yeah, whooh
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it!

All the children of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes it's alright
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Take the news to the marching men
Who are killing their brothers, when death won't do, whooh
'Cause we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside of me is inside of you

Now tell me!
Can you feel it, tell me can you feel it, can you feel it!
Whoeeh!

Can you see what's going down
Can you feel it in your bones, can you feel it!
Wheeah
Yeah, yeah, whooh


Every breath you take
Is someone's death in another place
(Another place, another place, another place)
Every healthy smile
Is hunger and strife to another child
(Another child, another child)
But the stars do shine
And promising salvation is near this time
(Near this time)
Can you feel it now
So brothers and sisters show we know how

Now tell me!
Can you feel it, tell me can you feel it, can you feel it!
Yeah, yeah, whooh
Can you see what's going down
Open up your mi-i-i-ind

All the children of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes it's alright
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Take the news to the marching men
Who are killing their brothers, when death won't do, whooh
'Cause we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside my veins is inside of you

Now tell me!
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it!
(Can you, can you, can you feel it)
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it!
