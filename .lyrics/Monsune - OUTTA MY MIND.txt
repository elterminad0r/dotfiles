[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
I've been waitin' for the right time
To let you know that I've been looking
For you all of my life
Feels like walking on a landslide
Let me take you, take you down, ah

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, let me get you into my life
Ooh, baby, I can't let you out of my sight
Ooh, baby, don't care if you ain't my type
Don't even know you
But I can't get you outta my mind

[Post-Chorus]
(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you outta my mind)
Girl I can't get you outta my mind
(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you outta my mind)
(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you outta my mind)
Girl I can't get you outta my mind
(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you outta, yeah)
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know you got it easy
You got me tossin' and turning
Thinkin' of what we could be
I been searching for the words
But how do I say everything I need to
Everything I need to (Yeah)

I been tryna get you outta sight and outta mind
You've been haunting me for 40 days and 40 nights
I know better than to keep checkin' if you're still online
I can't help it, I can't help it, no

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, let me get you into my life
Ooh, baby, I can't let you out of my sight
Ooh, baby, I don't care if you ain't my type
Don't even know you
But I can't get you outta my mind

[Post-Chorus]
(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you outta my mind)
Girl I can't get you outta my mind
(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you outta my mind)
(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you outta my mind)
Girl I can't get you outta my mind
(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you outta my-, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, aah

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, let me get you into my life
Ooh, baby, can't let you out of my sight
Ooh, baby, don't care if you ain't my type
Don't even know you
But I can't get you outta my mind

[Post-Chorus]
(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you outta my mind)
Girl I can't get you outta my mind
(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you outta my mind)
(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you outta my mind)
Girl I can't get you outta my mind
(I can't get you, I can't get you, get you outta my-, yeah)
