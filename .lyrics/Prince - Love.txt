Ooh! {x2}
Ow!

Stop telling me what you want me 2 hear
Stop telling me what you want me 2 fear
Stop tripping on somethin' you overheard
Love is winning without a word
Stop giving me your wish list
Love is free from all this

Like a bird flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, U know it never stops
From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever, whatever you want it 2 be

Love is not a game you can play on the floor
U gotta stop keeping score
(If you wanna) If you wanna play me like you did b4
U better stop and walk out the door
We could skate around the issues if you like
But who's gon' get you high in the middle of the night?

Oh
Whoa whoa oh
Oh

I see you standing wit' your back on the wall
U better, better get your hands up and clap if that's all
And uh, if you don't wanna get yours, then let me get mine
See, ain't gonna be no drama 'cause we have a good time

What's the point in giving me ultimatums?
Smilin' at my friends when you really hate 'em
Tryin' 2 convince me that I should 2
What's the point?

Stop worryin' about what people say
When you ain't gon', ain't gonna stop 'em anyway, uh
Love can do anything if you try
Come on, spread your wings and let's fly, uh

Fly so high, fly, flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, U know it never stops (Ain't gonna stop, now)
From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks (Speak 2 me)
Love is whatever, whatever, whatever...

(Speak 2 me, uh)
(Talking 'bout love now)

Whatever you want it 2 be {x3}
(Talking 'bout love, now)
All right, let's skate!

Uh!

Come on,
I see you standin' wit' your back on the wall
U better get your hands up and clap if that's all
If you don't wanna get yours, then let me get mine
See, ain't gonna be no drama 'cause we have a good time

Bounce!
Ah, shake that thang, come on
Ah, bounce it, baby
Ah, shake that thang, come on
Good God!
