Uh, Flip with me,
Might be cool.

Who gave you permission to rearrange me
Certainly not me
Who told you that it was all right to love me
Certainly, certainly not me.

I was not looking for no love affair, baby
And now you wanna fix me
I was not looking for no love affair
And now you want to mold me
Was not looking for no love affair, baby
Now you wanna kiss me
Was not looking for no love affair
And now you wanna control me
Hold me

I know you're trying to get creative with my love
And that's all right, but
You tried to get a little tricky
Turned my back
And then you slipped me a mickey.

Certainly, certainly, certainly not me (I wasn't ready)
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me

Goodbye, but now it goes, (when I wake up)
I don't need nobody tellin' me the time, ooh uh uh oh

Who gave you permission to rearrange me
Certainly not me
No way, no
Who told you that it was all right to love me
Certainly, certainly not me

I was not looking for no love affair
And now you wanna fix me
I was not looking for no love affair
And now you want to mold me
Was not looking for no love affair
Now you wanna kiss me
Was not looking for no love affair
And now you wanna control me
Hold me

I know you're trying to get creative with my love
And that's real cute, boy,
You tried to get a little tricky
Turned my back
And then you slipped me a mickey.

Certainly, certainly, certainly not me (ooh)
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me (ooh)
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me (ooh)
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me (ooh)

You know that that was mine,
When I wake up (when I wake up)
I don't need nobody tellin' me the time, no
The world is mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, uh, (when I wake up)
I don't need no middle,
Rollin' over,
Lookin' after me.
