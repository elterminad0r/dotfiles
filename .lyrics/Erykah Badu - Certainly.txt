"Certainly"

Who gave you permission to rearrange me
Certainly not me
Who told you that it was all right to love me
Certainly, certainly not me

I was not looking for no love affair
And now you wanna fix me
Was not looking for no love affair
And now you want to mold me
I was not looking for no love affair
Now you wanna kiss me
Was not looking for no love affair
And now you wanna control me
Hold me

I know you're really trying to get creative with me love
And that's all right, but
You tried to get a little tricky turned my back
And then you slipped me a mickey.

Certainly, certainly, certainly not me
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me

The world is mine
When I wake up (when I wake up)
I don't need nobody telling me the time

Who told you that it was all right to love me
Certainly not me
No way no

Who gave you permission to rearrange me
Certainly, certainly not me
Well no, no, no
I was not looking for no love affair
And now you wanna fix me
Was not looking for no love affair
And now you wanna mold me
I was not looking for no love affair
No, no, no
And now you wanna kiss me
I was not looking for no love affair, no,
And now you wanna control me
Hold me

You're really trying to get creative with me love
And that's really cute, but
You tried to get a little tricky turned my back
And then you slipped me a mickey.

Certainly, certainly, certainly not me
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me
Certainly, certainly, certainly not me

The world is mine
When I wake up (When I wake up)
I don't need nobody telling me the time

(Certainly)
Certainly not me
(Certainly)
I was not looking, was I looking for no love affair
(Certainly)
Certainly not me
Oh, no, no way
(Certainly)
