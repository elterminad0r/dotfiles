'T'ain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
'T'ain't no big thing
The toll of the bell

Aggravated
Spare for days
I troll downtown
The red light place

Jump up, bubble up
What's in store
Love is the drug
And I need to score

Showing out, showing out
Hit and run
Boy meets girl
Where the beat goes on

Stitched up tight
Can't shake free
Love is the drug
Got a hook on me

Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me

Late that night
I park my car
Stake my place
In the singles bar

Face to face
Toe to toe
Heart to heart
As we hit the floor

Lumber up
Limbo down
The locked embrace
The stumble 'round

I say "Go"
She say "Yes"
Dim the lights
You can guess the rest

Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug got a hook in me

Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me

Love is, love is
Love is the drug
