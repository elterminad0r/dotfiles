Oh Oh Oh

Touching the heart of me
That's what you do baby can't you see
Right now you got me falling
I'm falling there's no stopping, no, no
Touching the heart of me

You can paint a picture using words
You can make me feel like top of the world
When you're near I'm never feeling blue
Cause you always know just what to do, do
Touching the heart of me

Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Everytime we touch,
It means so much
And it's all because of you
Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Everytime you're near
I have no fear and
It's all because of you

Because...

You're the best thing in my life
When I'm with you it feels so right
Oh how I miss you when you're gone
Although you're never gone for long, long
Touching the heart of me

You know just how to cherish me
You know exactly how I feel
With you I'm always feeling fine
So fine you know you blow my mind, my mind
Touching the heart of me

Because of you

Should you ever feel the need
Wanna fly away
I won't fight to change your mind
I'll try to make you see

Touching the heart of me
That's what you do baby can't you see
Right now you got me falling
I'm falling there's no stopping, no, no
Touching the heart of me

Chorus to fade
