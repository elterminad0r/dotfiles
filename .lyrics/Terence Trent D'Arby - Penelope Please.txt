I'm seventeen and under the illusion
A girl like you could end my confusion
Penelope please
Penelope please

My jeans are not
Big enough to hold me
So come on girl
Don't you try and scold me
Penelope please
Penelope please

You will still be home in time
To watch the 'Pops' featuring Chrissie Hynde

I know you see me as an aggravation
I dream of you in full moon frustration
Penelope please
Penelope please

Don't make me wait
But answer with affection
So come on girl
Look in my direction
Penelope please
Penelope please

You will still be home in time
To watch the 'Pops' featuring Chrissie Hynde

I know you view me as a major horror
But come on babe
Don't say sayonara
Penelope please
Penelope please

My head is hard
So girl I will continue
To plead and beg
Baby till I win you
Penelope please
Penelope please

You will still be home in time
To watch the 'Pops' featuring Chrissie Hynde

At twenty-one I came to this conclusion
I married her
But still I'm in confusion

Penelope please
("Come on babe")
("No!")
Penelope please
("No!")
Penelope please
("Look you're going to wake up the baby!")
Penelope please
("No!") Waaaaaaah!...
