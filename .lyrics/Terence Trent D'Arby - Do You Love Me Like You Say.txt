Now do you love me like you say you do baby?
(Do you love me like you say you do?)

Listen baby, until I find the river
I won't be satisfied with who I am
In my Monasteryo your love ran hot or cold
Symphony or damn
I wanna be careful not to lose by laughter
What I've gained by tears
So here's a question baby
You answer I most need to hear

Now do you love me like you say you do baby?
(Do you love me like you say you do?)

I give my best to the best of your breed
Take my heart pretty baby
I believe that I have all that I need
I exist for you wholly in this hour
As the leaves exist
Surely for the sake of the flower

Now do you love me like you say you do baby?
(Do you love me like you say you do?)

It seems that you have all these emotional dragons
That you must slay
I believe your daddy didn't treat you right
So it seems now TTD must pay
The troubles advance while the sorrows retreat
Yet whichever road you travel baby
I genuinely wish you godspeed
But before you go answer my question

Now do you love me like you say you do baby?
(Do you love me like you say you do?)
