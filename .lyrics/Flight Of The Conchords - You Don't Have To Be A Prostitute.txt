Ooh
It's a cold night, beneath the street light, there's a man whose pants are too tight
Oh no, his pants are too tight
My pants are too tight
He stands there, an empty stare, trying to make enough money for his cab fare home
He'll have to walk home tonight
Don't have enough for the ride
The streets are cruel, he tries to act cool, he goes to work with only his one tool
You can put away your tool, Jemaine

You don't have to be, a prostitute
No no no no no
You can say no, to being a man hoe
A male gigolo
You don't have to be, a prostitute
No no no no no
You can say no to being a night looker, boy hooker, rent boy, bro, hoe

He can't see his way out
I can not see my way out
He can't see his way out
Male prostitution seems to be my only option
He can't see his way out
I can not see my way out
He can't see his way out
No, no, no, no, no

He sends cheap thrills, to pay expensive bills
But check your résumé, you must have some other skills
Do you have any other skills?
Like typing?

They see him, want him to please them, want him to play them, but they don't even pay him
Oh no, they don't think he's worth it at all
Don't think I know when, he tries to bring them home, maybe that would be a way if he lived alone
Oh, you have a roommate Jemaine, don't bring them home

You don't have to be, a prostitute
No no no no no
You can say no, to being a man hoe
A male gigolo
You don't have to be, a prostitute
No no no no no
You can say no to being a night looker, boy hooker, rent boy, bro, hoe
