(Curtis Mayfield)

From out of nowhere, through a caravan, around the campfire light
Came a lovely woman in motion with hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like those of a cat in the dark
And she hypnotized me with love

She was a Gypsy Woman
She danced around and 'round to guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow
How she enchanted me
How I'd love to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you Gypsy Woman
I want you Gypsy Woman
I need you Gypsy Woman
Just got to have a Gypsy Woman

All through the caravan, she was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun, everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go, knowing she'll never know
That I love her, I love her

I love you Gypsy Woman
I want you Gypsy Woman
I need you Gypsy Woman
Just got to have a Gypsy Woman
