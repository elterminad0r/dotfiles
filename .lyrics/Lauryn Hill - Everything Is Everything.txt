Everything (everything)
Is Everything (is everything)
What is meant to be, will be
After winter (after winter)
Must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

Everything (everything)
Is Everything (is everything)
What is meant to be, will be
After winter (after winter)
Must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

I wrote these words (I wrote these words)
For everyone who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception in
Instead of what is truth

It seems we lose the game
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? (Who made these rules?)
We're so confused (We're so confused)
Easily led astray

Let me tell ya that
Everything is everything
(Everything is everything)
Everything is everything (everything)
After winter (after winter)
Must come spring
Everything is everything

I philosophy
Possibly speak tongues
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist
Rap this in fine linen
From the beginning
My practice extending across the atlas
I begat this
Flippin' in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper-slash-actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras

Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of Sister Betty
L. Boogie spars with stars and constellations
Then came down for a little conversation
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum
Now hear this mixture
Where hip hop meets scripture
Develop a negative into a positive picture

Now everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
(What is meant to be, will be)
After winter (after winter)
Must come spring (Must come spring)
Change, it comes eventually

Sometimes it seems (sometimes it seems)
We'll touch that dream (we'll touch that dream)
But things come slow or not at all
And the ones on top (the ones on top)
Won't make it stop
So convinced that they might fall

Let's love ourselves then we can't fail
To make a better situation
Tomorrow (Tomorrow)
Our seeds will grow (our seeds will grow)
All we need is dedication

Let me tell ya that
Everything is everything
(Everything is everything)
Everything is everything
(Everything is everything)
After winter, must come spring
Everything is everything
(Everything is everything)

Everything (everything) is everything (is everything)
What is meant to be, will be
After winter (after winter)
Must come spring (must come spring)
Change, it comes eventually
