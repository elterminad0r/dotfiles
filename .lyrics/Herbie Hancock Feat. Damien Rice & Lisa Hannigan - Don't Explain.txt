Hush now, don't explain;
There ain't nothing to gain
Well, I'm glad you're back,
But don't explain

Quiet, baby, don't explain;
You know there ain't nothing to gain
Skip that lipstick
And don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
I am so completely yours
Don't wanna hear nobody chatter
'Cause I know you cheat
Right or wrong, don't matter
When you're with me, sweet

Hush now, don't explain;
You are my joy, and you're my pain
My life's yours, love
So don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
I am so completely yours
Don't wanna hear folks chatter
'Cause I know you cheat
Right or wrong, don't matter
When I'm with you, sweet

Hush now, don't explain;
You know, you're my joy and you're my pain
My life's yours, love
Don't explain
