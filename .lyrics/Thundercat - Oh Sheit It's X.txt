The room is spinning
And I'm not winning
It's about 3:42
And I don't know where the bathroom is
My friends say "You should eat something"
But I'm not hungry, just wanna keep dancing in this corner, baby
This song is jammin'
So let's just slide on the dance floor, baby
Onto the dance floor

I just wanna party, you should be here with me
In this ecstasy, baby
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
In this ecstasy, baby
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
I'm on ecstasy, baby
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
In this ecstasy, baby

Who are you? Why you talking so loud?
I forgot you was my friend
Your purse is nice, baby, is it leather?
Or could it be suede?
I'm confused as hell, stuck in pattern grid world
Don't want it to stop
(Ugh) Oh shit, I fucked up

I just wanna party, you should be here with me
In this ecstasy, baby
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
In this ecstasy, baby
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
I'm on ecstasy, baby
I just wanna party, you should be here with me
In this ecstasy, baby
