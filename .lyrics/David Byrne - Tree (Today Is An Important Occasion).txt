Today is an important occasion.
She thinks that she must wear the right clothes.
The right combination of clothes - will make her lucky.
But there are specific kinds of luck - and different kinds are are needed - for different occasions:
A blue dress for intuition
The grey shirt and maroon slacks - for making strong statements
The navy pullover - and her woollen skirt - for discovering mystery
She thinks of what she wore - on a similar occasion - like the one she will be involved in today.
Particularly a similar occasion - that was successful for her.
She lies on the bed - and imagines herself in a variety of outfits.
She quickly narrows - the range of possibilities.
She tries them on - in a few combinations.
The striped shirt - and corduroy slacks.
The red dress.
She leaves the house - the outcome - is certain.
