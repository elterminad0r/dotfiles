I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally

I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I can cast a spell
With secrets you can't tell
Mix a special brew
Put fire inside of you

But anytime you feel danger or fear
Instantly I will appear, yeah, 'cause

I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I can sense your needs
Like rain on to the seeds
I can make a rhyme
Of confusion in your mind

And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
That's what I've got plenty of, 'cause

I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally

I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I ain't braggin'
'Cause I'm the one
You just ask me
Ooh, and it shall be done

And don't bother to compare
'Cause I've got it

I've got it
I've got it, yeaheah

I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman

I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman

I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman

I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
