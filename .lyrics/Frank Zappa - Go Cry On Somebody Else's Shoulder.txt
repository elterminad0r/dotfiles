A year ago today
Was when you went away
But now you come back knocking on my door
And you say you're back to stay
But I say

Go cry on somebody else's shoulder
I'm somewhat wiser now and one whole year older
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you anymore

You cheated me baby and told some dirty lies about me
Fooled around with all those other guys
That's why I had to set you free
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you anymore

A year ago today you went away
And now you come back crying
Crying, "Darling, please, let me in."
But I don't need you
No, I don't love you anymore
So go lean on, go cry on somebody else's door

Go cry on somebody else's shoulder
I'm somewhat wiser now and one whole year older
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you anymore

Oh, my darling
Go ahead and cry
Go ahead and let the tears fall out of your eye
Let 'em fall on your dress
Who cares if it makes a mess?

I gave you my high school ring
At the root beer stand
We had a teenage love, baby
I thought it was sharp, it was really so grand, but

You cheated me baby and told some dirty lies about me
Fooled around with all those other guys
That's why I had to get my khakis pressed
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you anymore

Baby
Baby, I love you so much, darling
Why don't you dig me?
I dig you but you don't dig me
I don't understand what it is
I, I had my car re-upholstered
I got my hair processed
I got a nice pompadour job on it
I bought a new pair of shoes
I got some new khakis and I met you
And we went out to get a Coca-Cola
