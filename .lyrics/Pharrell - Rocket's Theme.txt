Did you read the paper?
They'll be coming for us soon
Come on, Rocket, we're going to the moon
We could shoot for the sun but that'd be too soon
So one step at a time, let's get the moon

Since you were a thought
Floating around in our minds
We knew that you could teach us
The true meaning of life

Is to try without fire
And blast through all our fears
You can fly so much higher
And take us all from here

Did you read the paper?
They'll be coming for us soon
Come on, Rocket, we're going to the moon
We could shoot for the sun but that'd be too soon
So one step at a time, let's get the moon

You could not be bought, boy
You'd be sold out all the time
Who wouldn't queue and long for
The vital meaning of life

Which is to ride heart and mind
And learn along the way
Find our stride inside
With no turbulence or sway

Did you read the paper?
They'll be coming for us soon
Come on, Rocket, we're going to the moon
We could shoot for the sun but that'd be too soon
So one step at a time, let's get the moon

You're the one, I promise you
Love is your rocket fuel
Nothing is stopping you
You're special

Keep climbing, impossible
At thousands of altitude
Isn't that what God would do?
You're special

Did you read the paper?
They'll be coming for us soon
Come on, Rocket, we're going to the moon
We could shoot for the sun but that'd be too soon
So one step at a time, let's get the moon

Did you read the paper?
They'll be coming for us soon
Come on, Rocket, we're going to the moon
We could shoot for the sun but that'd be too soon
So one step at a time, let's get the moon
