Lookin' at the devil
Grinnin' at his gun
Fingers start shakin'
I begin to run
Bullets start chasin'
I begin to stop
We begin to wrestle
I was on the top

I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf again
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf again

Stiff all in the collar
Fluffy in the face
Chit chat chatter tryin'
Stuffy in the place
Thank you for the party
But I could never stay
Many thangs is on my mind
Words in the way

I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf again
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf again

Dance to the music
All night long
Everyday people

Sing a simple song
Mama's so happy
Mama start to cry
Papa still singin'
You can make it if you try

I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf again
(Different strokes for different folks, yeah)
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf again

Flamin' eyes of people fear
Burnin' into you
Many men are missin' much
Hatin' what they do
Youth and truth are makin' love
Dig it for a starter, now
Dyin' young is hard to take
Sellin' out is harder

Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf again
I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf again
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf again
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf again
I want to thank you falettinme
Be mice elf again
