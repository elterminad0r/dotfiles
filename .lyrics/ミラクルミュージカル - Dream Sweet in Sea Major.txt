Alone at the edge of a universe humming a tune
For merely dreaming we were snow

A siren sounds like the goddess who promises endless apologies of paradise
And only she can make it right
So things are different tonight

We'll go together in flight

It's now & never
A reverie endeavor
Awaits somnambulant directives to take the helm

Believe me darling
The stars were made for falling
Like melting obelisks as tall as another realm

Un ensemble d'enfants
La galaxie s'étend
Jardin de l'imagination

Combler la lacune
Rouler passe à la lune
La comme a nous évoluons

It feels like flying
But maybe we're dying
A cosmic confluence of pyramids hologrammed

She knows you heard her
Staging music murder
In line before the show began to be where I am

Children born of one emotion
Our devotion's deepest ocean
No division reasoned
We'll be free

To know
We are beyond a bow
And lo the hues arrange to show
It's perfectly clear

You look quite divine tonight
Here among these vibrant lights
Pure delights surround us as we sail
Signed yours truly the whale

Joy mirage's kingdom come
No one left at stake
Now that existence is on the wake
Let's see what we can make

Apart is wholly ending
A line in any final song
So long so far

We will be atoning
At last eternal through the past
Above a blinding star

Bye HI
Sigh Hawaii
We never meant to part
Sublime thy art

One light
Higher than the sun
Invisible to some
Until its time
