People go by, go by and go by
People go by, go by and go by
People go by, go by and go by
People go by, go by and go by
People go by, go by and go by

Walking down the street watching people go by
(Watching you, watching you)
Watching you
(Watching you, watching you)

Walking down the street watching people go by
(Watching you, watching you)
Watching you
(Watching you, watching you)

I can make you happy
Sometimes blue, yeah
Feel the need this time
Feel the things that I feel for you
True, true

Life has no rules
It's a face in a changing world
If you win there's a price
That you must pay

Walking down the street watching people go by
(Watching you, watching you)
Watching you
(Watching you, watching you)

Walking down the street watching people go by
(Watching you, watching you)
Watching you
(Watching you, watching you)

People, from far and ride
Brought together as a nation to ride
We've all got to analyze
Situations that need no disguise

Lend your hand to understand
Spreading joy and love throughout the land
Lend a hand, Mister
Won't you, won't you understand?

Gotta make it right, Mister
Together and hold it very tight now
Gotta make it right
Together, make it tight

Walking down the street watching people go by
(Watching you, watching you)
Watching you
(Watching you, watching you)

Walking down the street watching people go by
(Watching you, watching you)
Watching you
(Watching you, watching you)

Walking down the street watching people go by
(Watching you, watching you)
Watching you
(Watching you, watching you)

Walking down the street watching people go by
(Watching you, watching you)
Watching you
(Watching you, watching you)

This time we make a stand
To be happy to live on this land
When only seems a few

Have the people on the street
Watchin' me, watchin' you
Watchin' me, watchin' you
Watchin' me, watchin' you, Mister

In most everything we do
Feel the need to do the things
That make life for you

Walking down the street watching people go by

Walking down the street watching people go by
(Watching you, watching you)
Watching you
(Watching you, watching you)

Walking down the street watching people go by
(Watching you, watching you)
Watching you
(Watching you, watching you)

Gonna make it right
Hold together tight

Walking down the street watching people go by
Watching you
Walking down the street watching people go by
Watching you
