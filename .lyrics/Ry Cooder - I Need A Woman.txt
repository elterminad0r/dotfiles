(Bob Dylan)

It's been raining in my mouth all day
Dripping down to my clothes
My patience it is wearing thin
Got a fire inside my nose
Searching for the truth the way God designed it
The truth is I might drown before I find it

Well, I need a woman
Yes, I do
Need a woman
Yes, I do
Someone who can see me as I am
Give the kind of love that don't have to be condemned

And I want you to be that woman
Every night
Be that woman
Treat me right

I've had my eyes on you, baby
For about five long years
You probably don't know me at all
But I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears
Now you don't frighten me
I ain't no defendant
And you look like it wouldn't hurt you none
To have a man of understanding

Well, I need a woman
Oh, don't I
Need a woman
Bring it home safe at last

I've seen you standing on the corner
Seen you sitting down in the park
Been watching you in the sunshine
Walking with you in the dark

And I want you to be that woman
Treat me right
Be that woman
Every night

Well, if you believe in something long enough
You just naturally come to think it's true
There ain't no wall you can't crossover
Ain't no fire you can't walk through
Well, believing is all right
Just don't let the wrong people know what it's all about
They might put the evil eye on you
Use their hidden powers to try to turn you out

Well, I need a woman
Just to be my queen
Need a woman
Black, white, yellow, brown, blue or green

Riding out with me at midnight
Like two Spanish desperadoes
Gazing down upon the futile world
In her Cadillac Eldorado
We will penetrate the storm
In search of truth that has not been tested
But she better bring along her checkbook
Just in case we get arrested

And I want you to be that woman
