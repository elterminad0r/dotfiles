All babies together
Ev'ry one a seed
Half of us are satisfied
The other half of us in need
Love's bountiful in us
Tarnished by our greed

Oh, when will there be a harvest... for the world?
(Harvest for the world)

A nations planted
So concerned with gain
As the seasons come and go, we won't wait in vain
Far too many, feelin' the strain

(A harvest... a harvest)
(A harvest... a harvest)

(A harvest... a harvest)
(A harvest... a harvest)
(A harvest for the world)

Dress me up for battle
When all I want is peace
Those of us who pay the price
Come home with the least
And nation after nation, tuning into beasts

When will there be... a harvest
When will there be... a harvest
When will there be... a harvest
When will there be... a harvest
When will there be... a harvest
When will there be... a harvest
When will there be... a harvest...
