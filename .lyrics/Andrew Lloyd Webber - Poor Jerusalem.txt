Christ you know I love you
Did you see I waved
I believe in you and God
So tell me that I'm saved

Christ you know I love you
Did you see I waved
I believe in you and God
So tell me that I'm saved

Jesus I am with you
Touch me, touch me Jesus
Jesus I am on your side
Kiss me, kiss me Jesus

Christ what more do you need to convince you?
That you've made it and you're easily as strong
As the filth from Rome who rape our country
And who've terrorized our people for so long

Christ you know I love you
Did you see I waved
I believe in you and God
So tell me that I'm saved

Christ you know I love you
Did you see I waved
I believe in you and God
So tell me that I'm saved

Jesus I am with you
Touch me, touch me Jesus
Jesus I am on your side
Kiss me, kiss me Jesus

There must be over fifty thousand
Screaming love and all for you
And everyone of fifty thousand
Would do whatever you ask him to

Keep them yelling their devotion
But add a touch of hate at Rome
And you will rise to a greater power
We will win ourselves our home

And you'll get the power and the glory
For ever and ever and ever
And you'll get the power and the glory
For ever and ever and ever

You'll get the power and the glory
(For ever Amen)
For ever and ever and ever
(For ever Amen)

You'll get the power and the glory
(For ever Amen)
For ever and ever and ever
(For ever Amen)

You'll get the power and the glory
(For ever Amen)
For ever and ever and ever
(For ever Amen)

You'll get the power and the glory
(For ever Amen)
For ever and ever and ever
(For ever Amen)

You'll get the power and the glory
(For ever Amen)
For ever and ever and ever
(For ever Amen)

Neither you Simon, nor the fifty thousand
Nor the Romans, nor the Jews
Nor Judas, nor the twelve
Nor the priests, nor the scribes

Nor doomed Jerusalem itself
Understand what power is
Understand what glory is
Understand at all, understand at all

If you knew, all that I knew my poor Jerusalem
You'd see the truth but you'd live a lie
But you'd live a lie while you live
Your troubles are many

Poor Jerusalem
To conquer death
You only have to die
You only have to die
