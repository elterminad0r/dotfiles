Here we are folks, the dream we all dream of
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Tell me, have you got the look?

You walked in, I woke up
I've never seen a pretty girl look so tough
Baby, you got that look

Color you peach and black
Color me taken aback
Crucial, think I want ya

You've got the look, you've got the hook
Sho'nuff do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin', your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look

Looka here
U got the look (U got the look)
U musta took (U musta took)
A whole hour just to make up your face, baby

Closin' time, ugly lights
Everybody's inspected (everybody's inspected)
But you are a natural beauty unaffected (unaffected)
Did I say an hour? My face is red
I stand corrected (I stand corrected)

You've got the look, you've got the hook
Sho'nuff do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin', your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look

There's no jokin' you
Well, here we are
Ladies and gentlemen
The dream we all dream of (oh, please)
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Slammin'

You walked in (I walked in), I woke up (you woke up)
I never seen such a pretty girl look so tough
Baby (Baby), you got that look (yes you do)

Color you peach and black
Color me takin' aback, baby
Crucial, think I want'cha

You've got the look, you've got the hook
Sho'nuff do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin', your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin' now
You got the look, you got the look

Here we are folks, the dream we all dream of
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
