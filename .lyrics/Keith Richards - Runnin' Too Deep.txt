We scorch the earth for all it's worth
Last night, you in ecstasy
Now you don't remember me.

It's runnin' too deep
It's runnin' too deep for me.

The sirens and the curfews through the night
Everybody's locked up tight
What's going on ? It's been dark for much too long.

It's runnin' too deep
Runnin' too deep
You know it's runnin' too deep for me.

If heaven looses face, what will take its place?

Runnin' too deep
You're runnin' too deep for me.

We've torn the treasure from the land
Watched it turn to ashes in our hands
We scorch the earth for all it's worth
Last night, you in ecstasy
Now you don't remember me.

Runnin' too deep
Runnin' too deep
Runnin' too deep for me.
