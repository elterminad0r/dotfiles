When you come I feelin' better
Sky is blue you say forever
Ooh ooh, I've been trapped by love
Then you go so change the weather
Sky is grey bit more than ever
Ooh ooh, I've been trapped by love...
I've been trapped by love
I've been trapped by love
I've been trapped by love...!

So my beer now taste so bitter
But I can't find anything sweeter
Ooh ooh, I've been trapped by love
Then you come and I feel better
See my eyes they're full of water
Then again you go
So change the weather...

Askin for the next together
I've been trapped by love
I've been trapped by love
I've been trapped by love...!

When you come I feelin' better
Sky is blue you say forever
Ooh ooh, I've been trapped by love
Then you come and I feel better
See my eyes they're full of water
Then again you go
So change the weather...

Askin for the next together
Askin for the next together
I've been trapped by love
I've been trapped by love
I've been trapped by love!
I've been trapped by love!
