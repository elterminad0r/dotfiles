Man, I ain't got time 4 that girl
Say what?
Yeah, she always want 2 talk 2 somebody
Believe me, I know her
Yeah

I see you at another party
Dancin' all over the place
Lookin' 4 the perfect body
2 go with the perfect face

Bushy head mulatto breakdown
And your lips got wet 2day (lips got wet 2day)
Same damn bird from london (same damn cuckoo)
Finally had the nerve 2 say (what'd she say?)
(I'll tell ya Â¨c listen)

I used 2 have mad sex in the horny morning
I used 2 have mad sex in the afternoon
I used 2 have mad sex when me and this mulatto go down
2 dirty up another room

Do it till your tattoo's dizzy
And the stud in your mouth turns gold
Till the animal prints you flaunt so lovely
Is full of little bloody holes

Bushy head mulatto breakdown
And your lips got wet 2day
The same damn bird from london


Uh, finally had the nerve 2 say (what'd she say?)

Mad sex {x2}

Steppin' up on the others tryin' 2 make a jealous brotha
Get you nothin' but another night of vibration
One nation under your groove and still you can't break my cool

I see you at another party
Once again the talk of the town
Break another heart, u sorry... skench!
One day u're gonna tumble down, down, down, down
(Tumble down, down, down)

Bushy head mulatto breakup
And you never really knew my name (what good is time)
What good is time if you take up (what good is time if you take up)
Every day 2 complain? (oh)

Dirty up another, dirty up another, dirty up another room (mad sex)
Oh yeah {x4} (mad sex)
I used 2 have mad sex {x3}
(Mad sex)
2 dirty up another room (dirty, dirty, dirty)
Mad sex {x2}
Dirty, dirty
Mad sex {x2}
