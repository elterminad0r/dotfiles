Open up your eyes
You can see me here
Open up your mind
I'm calling you here

In the heat of the night, I'm calling
Listen to the sound, I'm calling to you
Can you hear the beating of my heart?
It beats for you

Burning desire, burning inside
Burning desire, flame is alive
And I know that it's right
In the heat of the night

Relationships are hard to find
When they all ask to read your mind
Reach inside your mind
You know what's happening, tell me

In the heat of the night, I'm calling
Listen to the sound, I'm calling to you
Can you hear the beating of my heart?
It beats for you

Wiping the sweat from my brow
Ain't no way I can reach you now
I hear you calling, teardrops falling
All the pain and love's combined as one

We used to have fun
But the memories still unwind in my mind
Till the end of time, holding you tight, yeah
In the heat of the night

I'm calling
In the heat of the night
I'm calling, I'm calling
Listen to the sound

I'm calling
I am your love, your love
I'm calling
Your love, your love

I'm calling
