We know, yes, we know
It's my ego on fantastic
But still, you're fuckin' with my plastic
Dedicated, medicated
They bend and break me, overrate me
I take a small piece, make it breathe
It takes a second to wreck it
Sucka niggas won't believe
They stress me, test me, vex me
So what, you got a gun?
That shit don't impress me
Yes, yes, you always walk with the crew
You're a motherfucker 'cause you're not alone
If you don't think I'm a brother, then check my chromosome
Brand new, you're retro
I already passed you on a one-two
I've been cued to this already
Bullet to the head
Bullet to the head, what you know I's joking?
What the fuck you doin'?
You gonna represent my intention?
You need more than a mic and a mention
Through the scars you see bars
Through the bars you see scars, results of my rage

Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro

Scared to skip and step in case you trip and fall
Thunder picks you up, slaps you on the wall
That's maniacal, I cuff through my manacle
Mechanical and super-natty
Love is not talk, I walk on by
Exotic spices
If your mouth can't tame the meaning
Be careful of the faces you're seeing
A dread of the past and fear of the future
That's maniacal, I cuff through my manacle
Mechanical and super-natty

Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro

Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro

Bullet to the head, what you know I's joking?
What the fuck you doin'?
You'll never represent my intention
You need more than a mic and a mention
Through the scars you see bars
Through the bars you see scars, results of my rage

Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro

Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro

Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro

Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro
Brand new, you're retro
