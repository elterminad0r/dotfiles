There comes a time in every man's life
When he gets tired of foolin' around
Juggling hearts in a three ring circus
Some day drive a body down to the ground

I never imagined that love would rain on me
And make me wanna settle down
But baby, it's true, I think I do
And I just wanna tell you that I wanna with you
And baby, if you do too

Oh forever, forever
Baby, I want you forever
I wanna keep you for the rest of my life (U can make right)
All that is wrong in my world, U can make right
(U are my savior, U are my light)
U are my savior, U are my light (Forever I want you in my life)
Forever I want you in my life (La da da da da da da da)
(La da da da da)

(Every man's journey)
There comes a road in every man's journey (don't be afraid)
A road that he's afraid to walk on his own, yeah (I'm at that road)
I'm here to tell you that I'm at that road
(And I'd rather walk with you than walk it alone)
And I'd rather walk it with you than walk it alone (U are my future)

U are my hero, you are my future (no past)
When I am with you, I have no past
Oh baby, my one and only desire (Make this feelin' last)
Is find some way in this doggone world to make this feelin' last
(Sugar, it's true)

(I know I do)
Oh baby, it's true ... huh, I know I do (Wanna with U)
And I just wanna tell you that I wanna with you, yeah
Baby, if you do too

Oh forever, forever
I want you baby, baby, forever(U can make right)
I wanna keep you for the rest of my life
(U are my savior, U are my light)
All that's wrong in my world, mama, U can make right
(Forever I want you in my life)

U are my savior, U are my light (La da da da da da da da)
Forever I want you in my life (La da da da da da da da)
(La da da da da da da da)
(La da da da da)

Forever in my life
Forever in my life
