Here we go
Lonely Island
Michael Bolton (Yeah)
The night starts now
Together on the track
The boys are back
The night starts now
Night starts now, baby roll with us
Chicks snappin' at the neck when we rollin' up (Rollin' up)
Cold flat doors ain't no holdin' up
Black card hit the bar like I gives a fuck

Flash in the eye when we walk into the se
Fuck the fellas looking jealous, pay the back and get wet
Three pound at my waist, shank in my sock
You either get cut, get stuffed or get shot

This is the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow
Pirate so brave, on the seven seas (What?)
A mystical quest to the Isle of Tortuga
Raven locks sway on the ocean's breeze

Yeah, that was kinda weird but we back in the club
Buying up the bar so the groupies show us love (Keira Knightley)
Motherfuckin' iceman, I'm the top gunner
Heater on blast, I'm the number one stunner (Jack Sparrow)

Watch your girl, 'cause I ain't your Mr. Nice Guy
More like the meet ya, take ya home and fuck ya twice guy (Yeah, yeah)
All dressed up with nowhere to run
I know I'll make ya feel crazy with the horn (Now back to the good part)

From the day he was born, (Ugh) he yearned for adventure (No)
Old Captain Jack, (Yeah) givin' them what for
He's the pauper of the surf, the jester of Tortuga
But in Davy Jones' locker, what lies in store?
(Yeah, we've seen the movie)

Put your hands in the air and say hell yeah, c'mon
Captain Jack (What?)
Johnny Depp (No)

From the front to the back, say we count stacks, c'mon
Davy Jones (Nope)
Giant squid (Wrong)

Michael Bolton, we're really gonna need you to focus up
Roger that, lemme try it with another film (Wait)
Life is a box of chocolates, and my name is Forrest Gump (Not better)
Though I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, I give Jenny all my love (Come on!)
Okay then, I'm a legal aide, Erin Brockovich is my name (Oh god)
Then you can call me Scarface, snorting mountains of cocaine (Close enough)

You cockroaches wanna play rough? Okay! I'm reloaded!

This is the tale, of Tony Montana (This is the tale)
Cubano flame, with Miami nuts (Take it home)
Got a basehead wife, her womb is polluted
This whole town's a pussy, just waiting to get fucked (Just waitin' to get fucked)

Okay, turns out Michael Bolton is a major cinephile
You complete me
Yeah, yeah, okay
