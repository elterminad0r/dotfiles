It was only last June
When her old man ran away
She couldn't stop crying
'Cause she knew he was gone to stay

It was 10:35 on a lonely Friday night
She was standin' by the bar
She was lookin' alright, yeah

I asked if she wanted to dance
And she said that all she wanted was a good man
And wanted to know
If I thought I was qualified, yeah

And I said, "Baby, don't waste your time.
I know what's on your mind.
I may be qualified for a one night stand.
But I could never take the place of your man."

It hurt me so bad when she told me
With tears in her eyes (tears in her eyes)
He was all she ever had
And now she wanted to die

He left her with a baby
And another one on the way, yeah
She couldn't stop cryin'
'Cause she knew he was gone to stay, yeah

She asked me if we could be friends
And I said, "Oh, honey baby that's a dead end
You know and I know
That we wouldn't be satisfied, no."

And I said, "Baby don't waste your time.
I know what's on your mind.
You wouldn't be satisfied (wouldn't be satisfied)
With a one night stand
And I could never take the place of your man."

Yeah, yeah, the place of your man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
