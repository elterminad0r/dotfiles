I think I've fallen in love with a girl, it's serious.
Ooh, that's great news, Bret, tell me about that girl that's so serious.
Well, I don't really know her.
Ooh, that don't sound so serious.
It's serious, I'm delirious.
Sounds serious.
Yeah.
That's cool, I met a new girl too.
Have you?
Yeah.
One of those girls you met on the 'net?
No, we really met.
Well, that's great news, what's she like? What does she do?
All I know, dog, is that she's careless with her dog. I'm not sure what she does, except she makes me want her. She makes me want to get on top of her.
Oh, that sounds great, man, that's sounds great, hey, wait.
What?
Maybe I'm crazy, but when did you meet this lady?
Just then.
When?
Then.
Right then?
Right then.
Where?
There.
Over there?
Over there.
Over there there?
Over there there there.
Just now?
Just now.

How'd you meet your lady?

I was going for a jog then she lost a dog.
I was running in the area and she lost a terrier.
Was this about forty seconds ago?
No, about forty-three seconds ago.

Ooh, no, oh no.
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

No, no, what?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No, I'm thinking what I'm thinking.
So you're not thinking what I'm thinking?
No, 'cause you're thinking I'm thinking what your thinking.
Are you talking about a girl with a beautiful smile?
Yeah.
Like strawberry wine?
Yeah, yeah.
Blueberry track suit pants?
White chocolate skin?
And socks?
That sounds like her.
Hang on a minute, stop the track. Eugene, stop the track. Do you mean the girl who came up to us when we were running in the park just now and she was looking for her epileptic dog?
Yeah, that's the girl.
Was her name Brahbrah?
No, I think it was Barbara.
Her name was Brahbrah.
It was Barbara, there's no such name as Brahbrah.
It's Brahbrah.
It's Barbara.
It was Brahbrah.
Barbara.
Brahbrah.
Barbara.
Brahbrah.
Barbara, Barbara.
Brah.
Bret, she was looking at me.
No, she was looking at me.
Bret, she was looking at me, she had her eye on my knee.
Dog, I'm sorry, she had her eye on my guns.
Are you loco? She was checking out my buns.
No, bro, she had her eye on me.
She had her eye on me.
Well, how could she have her eye on both of us? Wait a minute, you talking about the girl with the lazy eye?
I think she might have had a slightly lazy eye.

We're both in love with a sexy lady with an eye that's lazy
The girl that's fly with a wonky eye
She's smoking with an eye that's broken, I think it's hot
The way she looks left a lot
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
