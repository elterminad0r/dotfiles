It's been a long time coming
I went away from you
Saw you for the first time again
But just couldn't get through
You were good to me now and then
Now our love is overdue
Don't you try to understand
That this is not the end that I planned
And don't you care to figure out
Why you can't mix milk with sauerkraut
You can't mix milk with sauerkraut
You can't mix milk with sauerkraut
You gotta stick to the recipe
I've spent a long time waiting
For a while I was lost
One made her forget everything
But you I just can't trust
You were good to me now and then
Now our love is overdue
And don't you try to understand
That this is not the end that I planned
And don't you care to figure out
Why you can't mix milk with sauerkraut
You can't mix milk with sauerkraut
You can't mix milk with sauerkraut
You gotta stick to the recipe
You can't mix milk with sauerkraut
You cannot mix milk with sauerkraut
You can't mix milk with sauerkraut
You gotta stick to the recipe
It's been a long time coming
I went away from you
Saw you for the first time again
But just couldn't get through
You were good to me now and then
Now our love is overdue
And don't you try to understand
That this is not the end that I planned
And don't you care to figure out
Why you can't mix milk with sauerkraut
You can't mix milk with sauerkraut
You can't mix milk with sauerkraut
You gotta stick to the recipe
