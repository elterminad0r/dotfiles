Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
Na-na, na-na-na

Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don't wanna tell you what it is
Oh wee, it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I wanna set it off, but

It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
(You did) This one thing my soul may be feeling
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it
(You did) This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

Hey, we don't know each other well
So why I keep thinking to myself
Memories just keep ringing bells
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Hear voices I don't want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
(You did) This one thing my soul may be feeling
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it
(You did) This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

Maybe I just can't believe it
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
I can't deny, tired of tryin'
Nothing left to do but to keep on seein' uou
I'm hoping you can keep a secret
For me, for me, for me
But what you did, yeah

It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
(You did) This one thing my soul may be feeling
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it
(You did) This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

(Oh whoa, whoa) I can't help it, it's just, uh
(Oh whoa, whoa) It's just, uh
(Oh whoa, whoa) It's that
(Oh whoa, whoa) I don't wanna fight

Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
(Oh)
Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
Oh, whoa

It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
(You did) This one thing my soul may be feeling
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's this one thing that caught me slippin' (oh no)
It's this one thing, I want to admit it
(You did) This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
(You did) This one thing my soul may be feeling
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it
(You did) This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Oh, whoa, whoa (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Oh, whoa, whoa (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
