Pilate:
And so the king is once again my guest
And why is this? Was Herod unimpressed?

Caiaphas:
We turn to Rome to sentence Nazareth
We have no law to put a man to death
We need him crucified - it's all you have to do
We need him crucified - it's all you have to do

Pilate:
Talk to me Jesus Christ
You've been brought here - manacled, beaten
By your own people - do you have the first idea
Why you deserve it?
Listen king of the Jews
Where is your kingdom?
Look at me - am I a Jew?

Jesus:
I have got no kingdom in this world -
I'm through, through, through

Mob:
Talk to me Jesus Christ

Jesus:
There may be a kingdom for me somewhere - if you only knew

Pilate:
Then you're a king?

Jesus:
It's you who say I am
I look for truth and find that I get damned

Pilate:
But what is truth? Is truth unchanging law?
We both have truths - are mine the same as yours?

Mob:
Crucify him!

Pilate:
What do you mean? You'd crucify your king?

Mob:
We have no king but Caesar!

Pilate:
He's done no wrong - no not the slightest thing

Mob:
We have no king but Caesar! Crucify him!

Pilate:
I see no reason - I find no evil
This man is harmless so why does he upset you?
He's just misguided - thinks he's important
But to keep you vultures happy I shall flog him

Mob:
Crucify him!

Thirty-nine lashes

Pilate:
Where are you from Jesus? What do you want Jesus? Tell me
You've got to be careful - you could be dead soon -
Could well be
Why do you not speak when I have your life in my hands?
How can you stay quiet? I don't believe you understand

Jesus:
You have nothing in your hands
Any power you have comes to you from far beyond
Everything is fixed and you can't change it

Pilate:
You're a fool Jesus Christ - how can I help you?

Mob:
Pilate! Crucify him!
Remember Caesar - you have a duty
To keep the peace so crucify him!
Remember Caesar - you'll be demoted, you'll be deported
Crucify him!

Pilate:
Don't let me stop your great selfdestruction
Die if you want to you misguided martyr
I wash my hands of your demolition
Die if you want to you innocent puppet!
