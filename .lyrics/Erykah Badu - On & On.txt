Oh my my my
I'm feeling high
My money's gone
I'm all alone
Too much "we'll see"
The world keeps turnin'
Oh what a day
What a day
What a day

Peace and blessings manifest
With every lesson learned
If your knowledge were your wealth
Then it would be well-earned

If we were made in his image
Then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God
But they fear us just the same

Oh on and on and on and on
(My cypher keeps movin' like a rollin' stone)
Whew on and on and on and on
(All night until the break of dawn)
I go on and on and on and on
(My cypher keeps movin' like a rollin' stone)
Ooh on and on and on and on
(Godamnit Imma sing my song)

I was born under water
With three dollars and six dimes
Yeah you might laugh
'Cause you did not do your math

Like 1... 2... 3
Damn, y'all feel that? Oh
Like 1... 2... 3
The world keeps turnin'
Oh what a day
What a day
What a day

The man that knows something
Knows that he knows nothing at all
Does it seem colder in your summertime
And hotter in your fall

If we were made in his image
Then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God
But they fear us just the same

Oh on and on and on and on
(My cypher keeps movin' like a rollin' stone)
On and on and on and on
(All night until you wrote your song)
I go on and on and on and on and on on on
(My cypher keeps movin' like a rollin' stone)
Ooh on and on and on and on
(Mad props to the god Ja Born)

I am feeling kinda hungry
'Cause my high is coming down
Don't feed me yours
'Cause your food does not endure
I think I need a cup of tea
The world keeps burnin'
Oh what a day what a day what a day

Your rush into destruction
'Cause you don't have nothin' left
The mothership can't save you
So your ass is gonna get left
If we were made in his image
Then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God
But they fear us just the same

Oh on and on and on and on
(My cypher keeps movin' like a rollin' stone)
Oh on and on and on and on and on on on
(You can't fuck with me so jus' leave me alone)
Ooh ooh wee on and on and on and on
(My cypher keeps movin' like a rollin' stone)
Oh on and on and on and on... on... on
(And on and on)
