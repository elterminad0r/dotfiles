Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Down to New Orleans, you know I love you so

Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
I'd get you way out here, I'll let you walk alone

Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
I beg you all night long, baby, please don't go

You brought me way down here
You brought me way down here
You brought me way down here
About to Rolling Forks, you treat me like a dog

Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Back to New Orleans, I beg you all night long

Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
I'd get you way out here, I'll let you walk alone

You know your man done gone
You know your man done gone
You know your man done gone
Down to county farm with all the shackles on
