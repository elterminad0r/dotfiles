You try your best to show me,
That you really care,
You said if there were days I was lonely to call you,
You'd be there,
You tried your best to convince me,
That you understand,
And if I ever need someone to hold on to,
You wanted to be the man

And I knew,
It was true,
All the feelings that I had inside for you
I cannot deny,
Many times I've tried, hoo, hoo

Give me a little more time,
I need to make up my mind,
'Cause you know I'm in two minds,
I wanna be more than your friend,
I just can't pretend any longer,
Feelin's gettin' stronger,

Give me a little more time,
I need to make up my mind,
'Cause you know I'm in two minds,
I wanna be more than your friend,
I just can't pretend any longer,
Feelin's gettin' stronger,

You've been there when I needed,
You've never let me down, (ha-ooh)
I just don't know how I'd cope without you,
Being around, (ha-ooh)
Feelin's have grown between us,
And friends we have been, (ha-ooh)
Don't you think it complicates this or is it,
Just me?

Then I knew,
It was true,
All these feelings that you had,
I shared them too,
I cannot deny the many times I lied, hoo, hoo

Give me a little more time,
I need to make up my mind,
'Cause you know I'm in two minds,
I wanna be more than your friend,
Oh, I just can't pretend any longer,
Feelin's gettin' stronger,

Give me a little more time,
I need to make up my mind,
'Cause you know I'm in two minds,
I wanna be more than your friend,
Oh, I just can't pretend any longer,
Feelin's gettin' stronger,

Oh, ooh,
All the feeling's that I had are for you,
I cannot deny,
Oh I just can't pretend any longer,
Feelin's gettin' stronger,
(Give me a little more time)
Oh, ooh,
(I need to make up my mind)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da,
('Cause you know I'm in two minds)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da,
(I wanna be more than your friend,
Oh I just can't pretend any longer),
Da-da-da,
(Feelin's getting stronger),
Oh, ooh,
Ooh-ooh,
(Give me a little more time,
I need to make up my mind)
All the feelin's that I had are for you,
I cannot deny,
('Cause you know I'm in two minds,
I wanna be more than your friend,
Oh I just can't pretend any longer,
Feelin's getting stronger)
(Fade)
