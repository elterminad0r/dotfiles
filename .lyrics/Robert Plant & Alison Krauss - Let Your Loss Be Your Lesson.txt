Once I had myself a good woman
But I just didn't treat her right
I was always leaving
Livin' a party life

True love was waiting for me
I was much too blind to see
Till she told me she would leave me
I said that's all right with me

Now she's gone
I realize I lost the best thing there is
And my pride keeps telling me
Let your loss be your lesson

Heaven knows I miss her lovin'
Heaven knows how much I cry
Just to think she had left me
And I know the reason why

I could tell she had been cryin'
It didn't seem to bother me
'Cause I know there's no one blinder
Than a fool who just couldn't see

Now she's gone
I realize I lost the best thing there is
And my pride keeps tellin' me
Let your loss be your lesson

Let your loss be your lesson
