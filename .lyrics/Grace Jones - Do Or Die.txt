I've been called an operator,
I can sell an eskimo snow,
Baby, you're a captivator,
But all you ever tell me is no.


You make me run, run, run, say your havin' none,
You make me run, run, run, chase me with a gun.
I'll never give up!
I've got to do or die,
I'm reachin' for the sky,
I'd like to make you mine,
You know I will in time,
No retreating gotta do or die,
No matter how you try,
You'll never change my mind,
I got to Do or Die!


Taurus' are more determined,
Nothing's gonna stand in their way,
Loving you was my ambition,
I was born the 19th of May.


You make me run, run, run, say your havin' none,
You make me run, run, run, chase me with a gun.
I'll never give up!
I've got to do or die,
I'm reachin' for the sky,
I'd like to make you mine,
You know I will in time,
No retreating gotta do or die,
No matter how you try,
You'll never change my mind,
I got to Do or Die!
