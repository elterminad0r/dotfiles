Super stupid bought a five cent bag
Thought it was coke, but it was skag
Super stupid did a one and one
Then his eyes begin to water and his nose begin to run

Oh, stupid with your ups and downs
Your maggot brain, your grins and frowns
Super stupid, you're here today
You've lost the fight and the winner is fear

Did-did-did did-um, did-did did-did-did-dum
Did-did-did did-do
Did-did did-did-did-dum
Whoa, hey
