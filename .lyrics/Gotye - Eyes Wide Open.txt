With our eyes wide open we...
With our eyes wide open we...

So this is the end of the story
Everything we had, everything we did
Is buried in dust
And this dust is all that's left of us

But only a few ever worried

Though the signs were clear, they had no idea
You just get used to living in fear
Or give up
When you can't even picture your future

We walk the plank with our eyes wide open...

We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
(walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...)
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
(walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...)

Some people offered up answers
We made out like we heard, they were only words
They didn't add up
To a change in the way we were living it

And the saddest thing
Is all of it could have been avoided

But it was like to stop consuming's to stop being human
And why'd I make a change if you won't?
We're all in the same boat, staying afloat
For the moment

We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
(walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...)
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
(walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...)
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we...
Mmm hmmm mmm

With our eyes wide open we
Walk the plank, we walk the plank
With our eyes wide open we
Walk the plank, we walk the plank, we walk the plank
With our eyes wide open we
Walk the plank, we walk the plank
With our eyes wide open we...
And that was the end of the story
