Round and round carousel
He's got you under its spell
Moving so fast
Going nowhere

Up and down Ferris wheel
Tell me how does it feel
To be so high
Looking down here

Is it lonely
Lonely
Lonely?

Did the clown make you smile?
He was only your fool for a while
But now he's come back home
And left you wandering there

Is it lonely
Lonely
Lonely?
