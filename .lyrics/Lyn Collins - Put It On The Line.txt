I need some security
I need some guarantee
Tell me what you're gonna do
Show me that you mean me good
Give me what you know what I need
Oh, put it on the line

I don't want no man lyin' and teasin'
I gotta have a man that's sure to please me
Can you take some time to hold and squeeze me?
Oh, put it on the line

Can you sit right down and put it on the line?
Why don't you do that for me?
Can you do that for me?
And why can't you be man enough to tell me where
you're comin' from?

I don't wanna stand no more heartache
I just don't know how much more I can take
Promise me ain't gonna be no more heartbreaks
Love, put it on the line

Can you get right down
And put it on the line?
Why don't you do that for me?
Please
Why can't you be man enough to tell me where you're
comin' from?

I need some security
I need some purity
I need some guarantee
Put it on the line
Put it on the line
Put it on the line
I've got to have a guarantee
Please love
Said I need some guarantee
Put it on the line
