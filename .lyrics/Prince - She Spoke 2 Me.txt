Spoke 2 me
I can't believe it but she spoke 2 me
Close 2 me
I never thought I'd get her close 2 me
Now the moon and the sun belong 2 me
All my wildest hopes were crazy dreams
(They seem more like reality)

Fantasy
This girl fulfills my every fantasy
She must be
Specially designed by heaven just 4 me
(Just for me)
My friends look at her, they see mystery
But I look at her and I see a masterpiece
(Can it be? I mean, really, that she)

Spoke 2 me (spoke 2 me)
I can't believe it but she spoke 2 me
(Speak 2 me baby)
(Speak 2 me baby)

Spoke 2 me
I can't believe it but she spoke 2 me
And if she hurts me
[I/I'll] take it all with open arms you see
(U think I won't?)
Cause like the track under a subway train
She could roll all over me and I'd still be the same
Cause today is the day she spoke 2 me
I can't believe it but she spoke 2 me
Close 2 me
I never thought I'd get her close 2 me

If I'm stuck in some groovy wet dream
Don't pinch me
(I don't wanna wake up)
I'm diggin' the scene (dig it dig it)
Yeah, baby
