If you begin to feel overload, you'll begin to feel what we are saying
If you begin to feel overload, consider your Earth looking for you

Ultrasonic sound
Ultrasonic sound comin' out your speaker

There are doors I haven't opened...
And windows I have yet to look through...
Going forward may not be the answer...
Maybe I should go back

Rhythm is the key as we open up the door...
Some musical rhythms can mess with your head
