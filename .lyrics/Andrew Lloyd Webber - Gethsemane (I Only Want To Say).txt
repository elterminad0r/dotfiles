I only want to say, if there is a way
Take this cup away from me
For I don't want to taste its poison
Feel it burn me, I have changed
I'm not as sure as when we started

Then I was inspired
Now I'm sad and tired
Listen, surely I've exceeded expectations
Tried for three years, seems like thirty
Could You ask as much from any other man?

But if I die, see the saga through
And do the things You ask of me
Let them hate me, hit me, hurt me
Nail me to their tree

I'd wanna know, I'd wanna know my God
I'd wanna know, I'd wanna know my God
I'd wanna see, I'd wanna see my God
I'd wanna see, I'd wanna see my God

Why I should die
Would I be more noticed
Than I was ever before?
Would the things I've said and done
Matter any more?

I'd have to know, I'd have to know my Lord
Have to know, I'd have to know my Lord
Have to see, I'd have to see my Lord
Have to see, I'd have to see my Lord

If I die what will be my reward?
If I die what will be my reward?

Have to know, I'd have to know my Lord
Have to know, have to know my Lord

Why should I die?
Why should I die?

Can You show me now that I would not be killed in vain?
Show me just a little of Your omnipresent brain
Show me there's a reason for Your wanting me to die
You're far too keen on where and how, not so hot on why

All right, I'll die
Just watch
Just watch me die

See how
See how I die
See how I die

Then I was inspired
Now I'm sad and tired
After all, I've tried for three years, seems like ninety
Why then am I scared to finish what I started
What You started, I didn't start it

God, thy will is hard
But You hold every card
I will drink Your cup of poison
Nail me to Your cross and break me
Bleed me, beat me, kill me
Take me now before I change my mind
