She is negative as can be
And she's weak emotionally
But she kissed me
And she put it there
She's got a chip on her shoulderblade
And her attitude makes me afraid
But she kissed me
And she put it there

She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
When I'm bare
She kisses me there

When she bets
She'd never hedge
She likes walking on the razor's edge
But she kissed me
And she put it there
She likes rap and metal really loud
And she makes her other home girls proud
But she kissed me
And she put it there

She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
When I'm bare
She kisses me there

She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
She kissed me there
The way no other girl has kissed me there
When I'm bare
She kisses me there

She's as simple as a girl can be
Yet she has a cool complexity
But she kissed me
And she put it there
When she met me I was still a boy
Now I'm an older woman's toy
Because she kissed me
And she put it there
