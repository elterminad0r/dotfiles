Let me be patient
Let me be kind
Make me unselfish
Without being blind
Though I may suffer I'll envy him not
And endure what comes
'Cause he's all that I got and tell him
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him and it'll be all right
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be all right
Now I may have faith to make mountains fall
But if I lack love then I have nothing at all
I can give away everything I possess
But am without love then I have no happiness
I know I'm imperfect and not without sin
But now that I'm older all childish things end.
I'll never be jealous and I won't be too proud
Cause love is not boastful
Ooh and love is not loud
Tell him need him
Tell him I love him
Everything is gonna be all right
Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on earth
But if I speak wrong then ooh what is it worth
See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love I was shown when our lives were spared
And tell him
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
