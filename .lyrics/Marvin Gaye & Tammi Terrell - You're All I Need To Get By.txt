(You're all I need to get by, I)

(You're all) Like sweet morning dew
(I need) I took one look at you
(To get by) And it was plain to see
(I) You were my destiny

(You're all) With arms open wide
(I need) I threw away my pride
(To get by) I'll sacrifice for you
(I) Dedicate my life to you (oh)

I will go where you lead (come on, baby)
Always there in time of need
Oho, ho, ho, and when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

There's no, no looking back for us
We got love, sure nuff that's enough
You're all, you're all I need to get by

(You're all I need to get by, I)
Oh, yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, baby
Listen

(You're all) Like an eagle protects his nest
(I need) For you I'll do my best
(To get by) Stand by you like a tree
(I) And dare anybody to try and move me

(You're all) Darling, in you I found
(I need) Strength where I was torn down
(To get by) Don't know what's in store
(I) But together we can open any door (oh, stay)

Just to do what's good for you (come on, darling)
And inspire you a little higher
Oh, I know you can make a man
Out of a soul that didn't have a goal

'Cause we, we got the right foundation
And with love and determination
You're all, you're all I want to strive for
And do a little more
You're all, all the joy under the sun
Wrapped up into one
You're all, you're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need (oh) to get by

(You're all I need to get by, I)
Oh, babe, (ooh) oh babe
Uh, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, yeah
I need you, darling (ooh, huh)
Oh, I need you (you're all)
All your love (all I need)
Oh, ho, ho, ho, oh
I love you, darling (oh, baby)
All I need (you're all I need)
I need your love (you're all I want)
Oh (oh)
All your love now (yeah)
Yeah (oh yeah)
