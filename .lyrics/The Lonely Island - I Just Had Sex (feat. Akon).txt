Sometimes
Something beautiful happens in this world (Akon!)
You don't know how to express yourself (and Lonely Island)
So you just gotta sing

I just had sex
And it felt so good (felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
I just had sex
And I'll never go back (never go back)
To the not-having-sex ways of the past

Have you ever had sex?
I have... it felt great
It felt so good when I did it with my penis
A girl let me do it
It literally just happened
Having sex can make a nice man out the meanest

You'll never guess where I just came from
I had sex
If I had to describe the feelin'
It was the best
When I had the sex
Man, my penis felt great
And I called my parents right after I was done

Oh, hey
Didn't see you there
Guess what I just did?
Had sex, undressed,
Saw her boobies and the rest

Was sure, nice of her
To let you do that thang

Nice of any girl ever (now sing!)

I just had sex
And it felt so good (felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
I wanna tell the world

To be honest
I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it
It doesn't really make sense
But man, screw it
I ain't one to argue with a good thing
She could be my wife
That good?
The best 30 seconds of my life (my life)

I'm so humbled by a girls' ability to let me do her
'Cause honestly, I'd have sex with a pile of manure (manure)
With that in mind
The soft, nice smellin' girl's better
'Cause she let me wear my chain and my turtleneck sweater

So this one's dedicated to them girls
That let us flop around on top of them (yeah)
If you're near or far
Whether short or tall (yeah)
We wanna thank you all
For lettin' us fuck you

She kept lookin' at her watch (doesn't matter, I had sex)
But I cried the whole time (doesn't matter, I had sex)
I think she might have been a racist (doesn't matter, I had sex)
She put a bag on my head (still counts!)

I just had sex
And my dreams came true
So if you had sex in the last 30 minutes
Then you're qualified to sing with me

I just had sex (everybody sing)
And it felt so good (we all had sex!)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her (I wanna tell the world)
I just had sex (I just had sex)
And I'll never go back (you don't know!)
To the not-having-sex ways of the past (-sex ways of life)
