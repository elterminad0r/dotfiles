I'll be clicking by your house about two forty-five
Sidewalk sundae, strawberry surprise
I got a cherry popsicle right on time
A big stick, mama, that'll blow your mind

'Cause I'm an ice cream man
I'm a one-man band, yeah
I'm an ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you

Baby, missed me in the alley, baby, don't you fret
Come back around and don't forget
When you're tired and you're hungry and you want something cool
Got something better than a swimming pool

'Cause I'm an ice cream man
I'm a one-man band
I'm an ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you, yeah

'Cause I'm an ice cream man
I'm a one-man band
I'm an ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you

See me coming, you ain't got no change
Don't worry, baby, it could be arranged
Show me you can smile, baby, just for me
Fix you with a drumstick, I'll do it for free

'Cause I'm an ice cream man
I'm a one-man band
I'm an ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you
Be good to you
Be good to you

Good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you
I'll be good to you
I'll be good to you
Doncha know I'll be good, yeah
