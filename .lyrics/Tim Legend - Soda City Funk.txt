[Verse 1]
Check it
Check it

Hey, you people over there
Let me see you throw your hands up in the air
It's a funky groove

[Pre-Chorus]
Made to...
Make you move! (Well alright, get ready to move)
So let the party, party, party, par—

(Uh)

[Chorus]
Do you wanna, do you wanna get funky?
Do you wanna get funky with me? (x4)

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Check it
Check it

(Ohhh)

I think I got’s the fever
I'm heated, pumpin' up
I’m pumpin' up the meter! (Word)
Label me a ring leader, mad party leader
Make you sweats up a storm
Liter, after liter, after liter. Spot. (Hey)
Can you dig it?
Come alive, y'all gimme what you got
Pick up, pump, stick up
Pump ya fist up
Yo, check this out I don't buck shots
I bust lip up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Til the morning light, gonna make you feel alright
Pump it up all night
Body rock
Show me what you've got, let "Rob Reck" wreck the boom spot
(Hey, hey!)
'Til the morning light, gonna make you feel alright
Pump it up all night
Body rock
Show me what you've got, let "Rob Reck" wreck the boom spot

[Chorus]
Do you wanna, do you wanna get funky?
Do you wanna get funky with me? (x4)

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you wanna get funky with me?
(Yeah)

[Chorus]

Check it, check it, check it out

[Verse 3]
Hey, you people over there
Let me see you throw your hands up in the air
It’s a funky groove

[Pre-Chorus]
Made to...
Make your move. (Well alright, get ready to move)
So let the party people say...

[Chorus]
Do you wanna, do you wanna get funky?
Do you wanna get funky with me? (2)
