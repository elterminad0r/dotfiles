(Ferry/Leonard)

Out of control
And as far I can see
No religion can save me now
Through I'm trying to believe
How could I know
Her madness'd cling
From the time of her first caress
To the final fling
When you know the name of the game
You can never play enough
Every drop of blood is the same
You can never shed enough
Out in the cold
In the wilderness again
Where I fight for my soul
I can see no end
When you know the name of the game
You never play enough
In the name of heaven you pray
You can never pray enough
Out of control
Wild flower don't you fade
Thundercloud on the hill
Let me lie in your shade
How could I know
Her madness'd cling
From the time of her first caress
To the final fling
When you know the name of the game
You can never play enough
And the way you love is the same
You can never give enough
When you know the name of the game
You can never play enough
In the name of heaven you pray
You can never pray enough
