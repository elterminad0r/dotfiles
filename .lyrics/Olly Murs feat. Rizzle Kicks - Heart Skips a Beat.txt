Olly Murs
My heart skips, skips, skips, skips, skips, skips a beat

Rizzle Kicks
(Olly Murs, True Lad, Rizzle Kicks, yea-aah)

Olly Murs
I can see you're not yourself
Even when you're here with me
I know that you're somewhere else

So put another record on, kiss and lead me on
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Listen to the same sad song, playing on repeat
'Cause every time we come this close
My heart skips, skips a beat

So come on, spin me around, now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this
That's when my heart skips, skips a beat

Oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh

So hung up, we can't let go
If you really have to leave
One more time just move me slow

So put another record on, play it on repeat
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
'Cause all you ever need to know is what you do to me
That every time you hold me close
My heart skips, skips a beat

So come on, spin me around, now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this
That's when my heart skips, skips a beat

Oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh

Rizzle Kicks
(Rizzle Kicks, yea-aah)
At the start of the night I was like whoa, let's have a team-talk
Playing with this lady isn't something I'd agree for
Vibes keep going up and down like a see-saw
Should'a just taken her to the cinema to see Saw

Would she let me sit with her, I figured
Her figure's a sure, sure winner
Plus I got a lead from the back, I'ma skip her

You make my heart skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip a beat (skip a beat)

So come on, spin me around, now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat (hold on)
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone (hold on)
So when you hold me like this
That's when my heart skips, skips a beat

Oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh (yeah, yeah)
Oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh
Heart skips, skips a beat

Rizzle Kicks
(my heart skips a beat)

Olly Murs
Oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh-oh
My heart skips, skips a beat
