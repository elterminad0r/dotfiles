Kissing like a bandit, stealing time
Underneath a sycamore tree
Cupid by the hour sends valentines
To my sweet lover and me

Slowly, but surely
Your appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly, softly
I'm falling in love with you

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers
Sing

Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do
Right beside a riverboat gambler, hahahaha
Erotic images float through my head
Say you wanna be a midnight rambler

Quickly, but quickly
The blood races through my veins
Quickly, loudly
I wanna hear those sugar bells ring

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers
Get up

On the beat now, uh

Come on now

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears, come on
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers
Uh

(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
Yeah, I feel like going on, I feel like going on
(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
Come on, come on, erotic images float through me
You midnight rambler, baby
Uh

(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
Woo-hoo, dig it, for you anywhere
I don't know, I don't care
(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
But all I know is
Gotta, gotta be a midnight rambler, baby
Uh
