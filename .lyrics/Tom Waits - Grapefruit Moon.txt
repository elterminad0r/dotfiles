Grapefruit moon, one star shining
Shining down on me
Heard that tune, now I'm pining
Honey, can't you see?

'Cause every time I hear that melody
Well, something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining
Can't turn back the tide

Never had no destinations
Could not get acrossed
You became my inspiration
Oh, but what a cost

Every time I hear that melody
Well, something breaks inside
The grapefruit moon, one star shining
Is more than I can hide

Now I'm smoking cigarettes
And I strive for purity
And I slip just like the stars
Into obscurity

And every time I hear that melody
It puts me up a tree
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining
Is all that I can see
