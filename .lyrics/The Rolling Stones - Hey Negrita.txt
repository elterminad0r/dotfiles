I say hey, Negrita, hey and now
Move your body, move your mouth
Shake lady, way down south
Shake it baby, in your home town

Come si chiama, what's you game
I'm just a poor man, what's your name
Shake your body, do it up now
Shake body, move it up now

Hey Negrita, hey now
Hey conchita, shake it up now
Ah yeah, do it up now
Bate las caderas, do it up now

Flash of gold in your ears, child
Flash of gold in your eyes
Saw the gleam in your mouth
Saw the steel in your thighs
Oh, I know

Bate las caderas, do it up now
Just a momentita, not so fast
I need a money, my sweet ass
I say, listen, I'm a poor man
My pay is low
Here's one last dollar, then we go
"One last dollar," she say, "I got my pride"
Going to get your boss, boy
Going to tan your hide

Oh. hey Negrita, hey and now
Hey Negrita, yeah, do it right now  (C'mon, boy)
Owwwwwwwww
Ah, shake it up

Hey Negrita, hey and now
Hey Negrita, hey and now  (Do it up)
Hey Negrita, hey and now
Hey Negrita, hey and now, ahh
Hey Negrita, hey and now, ahh
Hey Negrita, hey and now  (Shake up your body now)
Whoa, shake it

Do it, do it
