Ev'ry time I look at you I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand
You'd have managed better if you'd had it planned
Now why'd you choose such a backward time and such a strange land?
If you'd come today you could have reached a whole nation
Israel in 4 BC had no mass communication

(Don't you get me wrong) Don't you get me wrong
(Don't you get me wrong, now) Don't you get me wrong
(Don't you get me wrong) Don't you get me wrong
(Don't you get me wrong, now) Don't you get me wrong

(Only want to know) Only want to know
(Only want to know, now) Only want to know
(Only want to know) Only want to know
(Only want to know, now) I only want to know

Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ
Who are you? What have you sacrificed?

Do you think you're what they say you are?
Jesus Christ Superstar
Do you think you're what they say you are?

Tell me what you think about your friends at the top
Who'd you think besides yourselves the pick of the crop?
Buddha was he where it's at? Is he where you are?
Could Mohammed move a mountain or was that just PR?
Did you mean to die like that?
Was that a mistake or
Did you know your messy death would be a record breaker?

(Don't you get me wrong) Don't you get me wrong
(Don't you get me wrong, now) Don't you get me wrong
(Don't you get me wrong) Don't you get me wrong
(Don't you get me wrong, now) Don't you get me wrong

(Only want to know) Only want to know
(Only want to know, now) Only want to know
(Only want to know) Only want to know
(Only want to know, now) I only want to know
