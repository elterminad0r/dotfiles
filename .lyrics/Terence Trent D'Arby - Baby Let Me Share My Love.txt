Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love

My best lines
Working on her, working on her overtime
Working on her, working on her clever mind
Working on her, working on her sleek lines
She's sure fine
As fine as Whitney Houston in the daytime
Working on her, working on her big time
Looking at her, looking at her waistline

Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love

My last dime
Working on her, working on her phone line
Working on her, working with the best wine
Working on her, trying to help her unwind
She's so fine
As fine as Cleopatra in her black prime
I think about her so much people, I'm a go blind
Working on her, looking at her waistline

Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love
Baby let me share my love

Jesus/Allah/Krishna/Buddha loves you

So not this time but next time
I'll be kicking out a poet's rhyme
Picking on her, picking on her grapevine
Working on her, looking at her waistline
She's real fine
As fine as Nefertiti in her black prime
Working on her, working on her bed time
Working on her, working on her
Working on her, working on her
Baby let me share my love
