Some sunny day, hey baby
When everything seems okay, baby
You'll wake up and find out you're alone
'Cause I'll be gone

Gone, gone, gone
Really gone
Gone, gone gone
'Cause you done me wrong

And everyone that you meet, baby
As you walk down the street, baby
Will ask you why you're walkin' all alone
Why you're on your own

Just say I'm gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone gone
'Cause you done me wrong

And if you change your way, baby
You might get back to stay, baby
You better hurry up if you don't wanna be alone
Or I'll be gone

Gone, gone, gone
Really gone
Gone, gone gone
'Cause you done me wrong

You done me wrong, but I'm out

Some sunny day, baby
When everything seems okay, baby
You'll wake up and find out you're alone
'Cause I'll be gone

Gone, gone, gone
Really gone
Gone, gone gone
'Cause you done me wrong
