My mama showed me how to rock in the cradle
But I learned how to roll along
My papa said "Son, gotta git some fun
'Cause when you're old, it ain't too good on your own"
Been so long since you heard my song
Gonna pick up my guitar and play
Felt so bad when I had to leave you
But I knew that I'd be back some day

So I'm comin' home
To give you more than you bargained for
Comin' home
No mistake, I'm gonna shiver 'n shake
Comin' home
Gonna rock 'n roll 'n give you my soul
Comin' home
I got over the pain, I'm comin' home again

Groovin to American Bandstand
B.B. onstage with "Lucille"
The thrill is gone but it won't be for long
'Cause you know I like to play how I feel
Now that we're all back together
Gonna shiver 'n shake all night
I just gotta say the music I play
Will sure 'nuff make you feel all right

Though I learned how to rock in the cradle
And rollin' came so easy to me
All the years I travelled the world
Made it all so clear to see
It's been so long since you heard my song
Gonna pick up my guitar 'n play
Felt so bad when I had to leave you
But I knew that I'd be back some day

Comin' home
To give you more than you bargained for
Comin' home
No mistake, I'm gonna shiver and shake
Comin' home
Gonna rock 'n roll and give you my soul
Comin' home
I got over the pain, I'm comin' home again
Comin' home
Shiver 'n shakin', anticipatin'
Comin' home
The thrill is gone but it won't be for long
