Oh my God, here you are
Prettiest thing in life I've ever seen
Close my eyes what's it like
What's it like inside your tamborine?

Oh my God, there I go
Falling in love with the face in a magazine (uh oh, not again)
All alone by myself
Me and I play my tamborine

Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine

Long days, lonely nights
Tamborine
Long days, lonely nights
Tamborine

I don't care for one night stands
With trolley cars that juggle 17
I just want to settle down and play around
My baby's tamborine

Tamborine, what are you
Why are you the star of all my dreams
(Star of all my dreams, are you a good tamborine)
Are you good, are you bad
Are you just unnecessary means

Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Trolley cars

Long days, lonely nights
Too bad we're not allowed to scream (yeah, yeah, too bad)
Guess that I'll stay at home
All alone and play my tamborine (aww)

Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
The tamborine
