Mary Magdalene:
Try not to get worried
Try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you
(Oh) Don't you know
Everything's all right
Yes everything's fine
And we want you to sleep well tonight
Let the world turn without you tonight
If we try
We'll get by
So forget all about us tonight

(Apostles' Women)
Everything's all right
Yes everything's all right yes

(Mary Magdalene)
Sleep and I shall soothe you
Calm you and anoint you
Myrrh for your hot forehead
(Oh) Then you'll feel
Everything's all right
Yes everything's fine
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And relax
Think of nothing tonight

(Apostles' Women)
Everything's all right
Yes everything's all right yes

(Judas)
Woman your fine ointment
Brand new and expensive
Should have been saved for the poor
Why has it been wasted?
We could have raised maybe
Three hundred silver pieces or more
People who are hungry
People who are starving
Matter more
Than your feet and hair

(Mary Magdalene)
Try not to get worried
Try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you
(Oh) Don't you know
And we want you to sleep well tonight
Let the world turn without you tonight
If we try
We'll get by
So forget all about us tonight

(Women)
Everything's all right
Yes everything's all right yes

(Jesus)
Surely you're not saying
We have the resources
To save the poor from their lot?
There will be poor always
Pathetically struggling
Look at the good things you've got!
Think while you still have me
Move while you still see me
You'll be lost
You'll be so sorry
When I'm gone

(Mary Magdalene)
Sleep and I shall soothe you
Calm you and anoint you
Myrrh for your hot forehead
(Oh) then you'll feel
Everything's all right
Yes everything's fine
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And relax
Think of nothing tonight

(Apostles' Women)
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And relax
Think of nothing
Everything's all right
Yes everything's all right yes
