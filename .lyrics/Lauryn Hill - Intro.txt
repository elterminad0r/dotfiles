Oh no, not you
What are you doin' here?
Our voice could be hard now
Can we put him in the back?

Robin, Robin, Robin
I used to get dressed for you'll now
I don't do that no more, I'm sorry guys
It's a new day, don't have the energy

You mind a joke
Okay so, these are brand new songs
And there are very few people who've heard
Very much about you know what I've heard

I've been going through and what I've been learning, lot of
Lot of wonderful life lessons, you know
They're not easy to come by but they're very blessed
After you realize why you had to go through
What you had to go through

It's just very important that you really listen to the words
You know and if you have a hard time hearin' what I'm sayin'
Please just raise your hand and you know or something
Object or you know whatever

You guys ready in there?
Okay and you know it's real intersting
Beacuse I used to, I used to be performer
And I, I really don't consider myself a performer so much any more
I really just, you know I'm, I'm sharing, you know
More or less the music that I've been given

But if I stop, if I start if I you know
Feel like saying baby baby baby for eighteen bar's
Whateverer, you know I just I do that
But I'm, all right, so you guys are cool
I'll talk to people on my head too, it's all right
Let's just warm up a little bit
Finish sucking my lozenge

This particular song is called Mr. Attentional
Let me see
We're all tuned up now
