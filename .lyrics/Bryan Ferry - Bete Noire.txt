I know you - inside me
Like poison like wine
Now there's no sense in falling
Say you'll be mine
Give me the world around you
Give me the time
Only a dream without you
Say you'll be mine


I've got - inside me
In darkness entwined
I would be lost without you
Say you'll be mine
Reflected in water
Imagined by fire
I will be waiting for you
Say you'll be mine
Beware bête noire
Beware bête noire
