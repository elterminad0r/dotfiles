Yo you don't even know about this girl I met last night

Stepped in the club now
Saw you sitting with your friends gigglin
Lookin' at me
Had to make my move
So I whispered in her ear
That I'll be your casanova
Come dance while you think it over
We made our way over to the dance floor
Gotta groove on
Dancing yeah real hard core
From the front to the back that's where I was at
You know you know Southampton man's do it like that
My body all over your (facciamo amore)
Damn sure
She was irresistible
The future was foreseeable

Girl you had me tripping
Girl you've got me tripping
My heart was feenin from the beginning
Just to hold your body drove me crazy
And it weren't like I had to pretend
That I'll be your casanova
If you'd only let me show ya
Felt like a drink so we went to the bar
Next thing we found ourselves in the back of my car
Making laugh and giggle... ha ha
My body all over your
I didn't want to take it too far
Especially in the car
Got more respect for ya (senorita)
Ooh yeah, now you're my partner

Good looking women
Those women that I can't even begin telling
Senorita that's the life you live
That makes you wanna
