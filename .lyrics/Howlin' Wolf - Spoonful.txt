It could be a spoonful of diamonds
Could be a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Satisfy my soul

Men lied about a little
Some of them cried about little
Some of them died about a little spoon
Everything fightin' about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that

It could be a spoonful of coffee
Could be a spoonful of tea
But a little spoon of your precious love
Good enough for me

Men lied about that
Some of them died about that
Some of them cried about that
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that

It could be a spoonful of water
Save you from the desert sand
But one spoon of lead from a .45
Save you from another man

Men lied about that
Some of them cried about that
Some of them died about that
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that

That spoon, dat spoon, dat spoonful
