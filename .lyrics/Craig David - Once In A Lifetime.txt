Once in my life I have the chance to find
Once in my life I have the chance to find
Once in a lifetime I have the chance to find the key to my dreams [and I know]
That it's so good for me
Once in a lifetime [in my life] I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
(And I know)
That it's so good for me

In the beginning trouble times in my life
I needed (just needed) a shoulder (a shoulder) to cry on
Had no direction until I met yooooooou
Everything is gonna be all right
Looking out beyond the stars
Searching, always wishing
Often I thought that love would escape meeeeeeee
You got the key babe

Once in a lifetime [in my life] I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
(And I know)
That it's so good for me
Once in a lifetime [in my life] I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
(And I know)
That it's so good for me

I was lost couldn't find my way
You took my hand and chased my blues away
Your inspiration is guiding me throooough
I'm feeling brand new
Memories of days gone by
Hurting, always hurting
You've taken my pain away finally
You set me free babe

Once in a lifetime [in my life] I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
(And I know)
That it's so good for me
Once in a lifetime [in my life] I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
(And I know)
That it's so good for me

Once in a lifetime [in my life] (Once in my lifetime) I have the chance to find
The key to my dreams (key to my dreams) and it's so good for me
Once in a lifetime (I have the chance baby) I have the chance to find the key
To my dreams [and I know]
(I have the chance to give you everything baby) That it's so good for me
Once in a lifetime...
