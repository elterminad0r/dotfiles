I never thought you would be the 1
That I'd wanna run 2
I never thought you would be the 1
That would make me care
And even though you've done me wrong
For some strange reason I can't explain
I get happy knowing you phoned
'Cause u're voice could kill my every pain
Why do we play this silly game?

I never thought you would be the 1
That I'd wanna give 2
A diamond ring, anything, that you ask me 2
But there you are bragging 2 u're friend
Making up a story that's so lame
That I was down 2 be u're sugardaddy
A one way ticket 2 ghetto fame
Why do we play this silly game?

Every other night you weren't at home
Out in the streets just actin' grown
Never with a bodyguard or chaperone
Then I hear a rumor that breaks my heart
Instead of takin' care of yourself u're tearin' yourself apart
Now why you wanna (why you wanna), why you wanna
Now why you wanna go and do that love?
Why do we play this silly game?

I never thought you would be the 1
That I'd wanna run 2
I never thought u'd be the 1
That would make me care
No matter how far I run, I'll never be the same
(I'll never be the same)
In the end, In the end, there's only us to blame

Why do we play this...
Why do we play this silly...
Why do we play this silly game?

Oh. Oh, oh, oh, ah
Tell me... why (oh why)
Oh why, Oh why, why, why, why
Why do we play this silly game?
