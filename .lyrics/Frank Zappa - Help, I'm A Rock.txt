Help I'm a rock, help I'm a rock
Help I'm a rock

Help I'm a rock, help I'm a rock
Help I'm a rock (Somebody), help I'm a rock (Please)
Help I'm a rock (Please), help I'm a rock (Please)
Help I'm a rock, help I'm a rock
Help I'm a rock, help I'm a rock (Somebody)

Wow man, it's a drag being a rock
I wish I was anything but a rock
Heck, I'd even like to be a policeman
Hey, you know what?
You know maybe if I practiced, you know
Maybe if I passed my driving test
I could get a gig drivin' that bus and pick some freaks up in front of Ben Franks, right?

Help I'm a cop, help I'm a cop
Help I'm a cop, help I'm a cop (Help I'm a rock)
Help I'm a cop (Help I'm a rock)

It's a drag being a cop
I think I'd rather be the mayor

Always wondered what I was gonna be when I grew up, you know
Always wondered whether or not, whether or not I could make it
You know, in society, because
You know, it's a drag when you're rejected
So I tore the cover off a book of matches
And I sent in
And I got this letter back that said, "Uhu, aha"
