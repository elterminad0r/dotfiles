It's late and I'm runnin' out of clever things 2 say
The kind that would bring a girl like U 2 tears
There's only 1 more glass of this rose'
Let's throw it on the fire with our past
And dance the night away

Until the sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we are - 4ever, always

It's late and I think it's 'bout time for you and me 2 get closer
2 get closer than we ever did before - oh
Whenever there's a tide you can let it ride inside your interior
Lay back, relax upon my shore, oh-oh
Oh baby, I wanna make love 2 U right here
One inside the other one - no fear, we're here

Until the sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we are - 4ever, always

Blow out this candle sunlight
Come lay down next 2 me
And paint another rainbow, oh~we
Oh eclipse this light with ecstasy

Do you like I do.
One, one, one, one, come on, come on
It's late and I'm walkin' out of what 2 say
The kinda lucky rhyme make a chippy wanna say
Whisper in the valley 2 me rock - n - rose'
Do you like I do come on and dance the night away
It's late but b4 they get 2 close the door
U and me we got 2 get out on the floor
Come on let the tide ride in and out the shore
I wanna love you once again - then some more
Lay u're head back I got my hand behind your head
Like you do the limbo 'cept it's on the bouncy bed
Bouncin' on the Summer Spring and when you start 2 Fall
U'll come like a cold Winter do in Montreal
Come on baby, under the sun and moon and stars
Let the tide ride (2x)

The sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we are - 4ever, always
