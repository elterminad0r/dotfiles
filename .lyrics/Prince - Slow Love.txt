Young is the night
It feels so right
Now that you're mine
Let's take our time

The man in the moon is smiling
For he knows what I'm dreaming of
Tonight is the night for making
Slow love

The gentle breeze
It blows with ease
Let's make it slow
Just like the wind blows

Let's make it last forever
For a hundred times wouldn't be enough
Tonight is the night for making
Slow love

Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
It's so much better when we take our time

Love's in your eyes (in your eyes)
Eyes never lie
Don't rush the feelin'
You got me reelin'

You can see through race car drivers
Let me show you what I'm made of
Tonight is the night for making
Slow love

Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
It's so much better when we take our time
