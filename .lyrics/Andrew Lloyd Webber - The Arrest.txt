(Judas)
There he is
They're all asleep, the fools

(Jesus)
Judas, must you betray me
With a kiss?

(Peter and Apostles)
What's the buzz
Tell me what's happening
Hang on Lord
We're gonna fight for you

(Jesus)
Put away your sword
Don't you know that it's all over
It was nice but now it's gone
Why are you obsessed with fighting?
Stick to fishing from now on

(Crowd)
Tell me Christ how you feel tonight
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?
Do you think that you may retire?
Did you think you would get much higher?
How do you view your coming trial?
Have your men proved all worthwhile?

Come with us to see Caiaphas
You'll just love the high priest's house
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die in the high priest's house

Come on God this is not like you
Let us know what you're gonna do
You know what your supporters feel
You'll escape in the final reel

Tell me Christ how you feel tonight
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?

Come with us to see Caiaphas
You just love the high priest's house
You just love seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die in the high priest's house

Now we have him, now we got him
Now we have him, now we got him

(Caiaphas)
Jesus you must realize
The serious charges facing you
You say you're the son of God
In all your handouts
Well is it true?

(Jesus)
That's what you say
You say that I am

(Annas)
Now that we have the gentleman
What more evidence do we need?
Judas, thank you for the victim
Stay a while and you'll see him bleed!

(Crowd)
Now we have him, now we got him
Take him to Pilate, take him to Pilate
