You know that my tears
Have kept me awake
The longer you're gone
I'll hunger and shake
From Warsaw to Rome
I'll wait out of time
With you in my heart
The Rhythm Divine

So won't you come close
Bring this to an end
With each Winter rose
My love I will send
So tender the night
When you hold me tight
With you in my heart
The Rhythm Divine

With you in my heart
The Rhythm Divine

You know that these tears
Have kept me awake
The longer you're gone
I'll hunger and shake
From Warsaw to Rome
I'll wait out of time
With you in my heart
The Rhythm Divine
The Rhythm Divine
The Rhythm Divine

With you in my heart
The Rhythm Divine
