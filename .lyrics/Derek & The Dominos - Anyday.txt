You were talking and I thought I heard you say, yeah
"Please leave me alone.
Nothing in this world can make me stay
I'd rather go back, I'd rather go back home."

But if you believed in me
Like I believe in you
We could have a love so true
We would go on endlessly

And I know, any day, any day
I will see you smile
Any way, any way
Only for a little while

Well, someday baby, I know you're gonna need me
When this old world has got you down (yeah, yeah)
I'll be right here, so woman call me, darlinâ€™
And I'll never, ever let you down, yeah

But if you believed in me
Like I believe in you
We could have a love so true
We would go on endlessly

And I know, any day, any day
I could see you smile (oh yes, I will)
Any way, any way
Just for a little while (only for a little while)

And I know, any day, any day
I will see you smile, I will see you smile
Any way, any way
Only for a little while

To break the glass and twist the knife into yourself
You've got to be a fool to understand (yes you do)
To bring your woman back home after she's left you for another
You've got to be a (you've got to be a man)
You've got to be a man

If you believed in me
Like I believe in you
We could have a love so true
We would go on endlessly

And I know, any day, any day
I will see you smile
Any way, any way
Just for a little while, only for a little while

Any day, any day
I will see you, I will see you smile
Any way, any way
(Just you wait and see, baby baby yeah)

Any day, any day
I will see you smile (oh, I'm gonna see my baby smilin' down)
Any way, any way
Just for a little, just for a little while
