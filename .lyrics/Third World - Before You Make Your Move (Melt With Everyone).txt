By William Clarke

Why do the birds sing songs
To warm a heart of love for you each day?
Why do the breeze blow so strong
To prove the power of love is here to stay?

We got to be able to melt with everyone
Before you find your groove
We got to try and understand everything
Before you make your move
Before you make your move

Why do the love we have inside
Refuse to be a part of someone else?
Why do we always run and hide
To keep a love so stocked upon a shelf?

We got to be able to melt with everyone yeah
Before you find your groove
We got to try and understand everything
Before you make your move



Before you find your groove
Before you make your move

(Keyboard Solo)

Before you make your move
(You don't got nothing to prove)
Before you make your move
Before you make your move
Melt with everyone

You gotta get up and make your move (Repeat)
