Damn you, you're so fine
Seems to happen to me each and every time we make love
I can't hold back
It's like having a hundred million little heart attacks
Damn you
Baby, you're so fine

Damn this kooky love affair
All I ever wanna do is play in your hair
2 people crazy in love
Into one another like a hand in a glove
Damn this kooky love affair

(Damn you)

Like animals just born to breed
Come to think about cha, baby, you're my only need
I'm on fire till you come and put me out
All I'm trying to say is that my psychedelic shouts
When you damn me
Damn you
When I'm in your arms it's all that I can do
When we're makin' love, I can't hold back
It's like having a hundred million little heart attacks
Damn you
Baby, you're so fine

Damn you
Baby, you're so fine

That one's dedicated to all the lovers

That was beautiful

This one's dedicates to the whores

What? you just...

Pimprag, check (Pimprag)

Just once will you talk to me?

Tootsie Pop, check (Tootsie Pop)

Not at me, not around me, not through me?

Raise your cane (Cane)

What do you believe in?

God

Who is your God?

You

Is this reality or just another facade?
