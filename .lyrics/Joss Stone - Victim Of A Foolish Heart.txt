Your scars were still showing when I first met you, baby
From all the wrong she had done to you
And I came along and applied a little loving
Slowly but surely I brought you through

Now she's back to rekindle that old flame
She's got a different angle, baby
But she's playing the same old game

Baby, don't be a victim of a foolish heart
Don't let her lies get next to you
She's just trying to tear us apart
And she's trying to make, to make me her victim too

Now I know she comes around here every time I leave
'Cause she knows she's still on your mind, on your mind
See, even a wise man jumps in misery somewhere down the line
But only a fool will jump the second time
Our affair is growing stronger every day
Don't let her come and steal our happiness away

Don't be the victim of a foolish heart
Don't let her lies get next to you
She's just trying to tear us apart
And she's trying to make, to make me her victim too

Now she's back to rekindle that old flame
She's got a different angle, baby
But she's playing the same old game

Baby, don't be a victim of a foolish heart
Don't let her lies get next to you
Oh, she's just trying to tear us apart
And she's trying to make me, to make me her victim too

I'm not gonna let her make me
I'm not gonna let her um
I'm not gonna let her make me
I'm not gonna let her um

Can't you see what she's doing to you boy

Don't be a victim
No, no, no, no
