Mmm yeah

Women think I'm tasty
They're always tryin' to waste me
Make me burn the candle right down
Baby, baby
Don't need no jewels in my crown

'Cause all you women
Is low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how
Baby, I go crazy
There's fever in the funk house now

This low down bitchin'
Got my poor feet a-itchin'
Know you know the deuce is still wild
Baby, I can't stay
Got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice

Always in a hurry
I never stop to worry
Don't see the time flashin' by
Honey, got no money
I'm all sixes and sevens and nines

Say now, baby
I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
Baby, I can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' my baby dice

Oh my my my
I'm the lone crap shooter
Playin' the field every night, night
Baby, I can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice

Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me Oh mm yeah
Got to roll me Oh hmm
Got to roll me Oh yeah
Got to roll me Oh hmm
Keep on rolling, got to roll me Oh oh
Keep on rolling, got to roll me Oh yeah
Keep on rolling, got to roll me

Now baby, call me the tumblin' dice, yeah
Oh baby, be my sugar, mine yeah
Oh, oh, now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Pretty darlin' baby
Oh oh, drunk on ya, baby
Baby, all night
