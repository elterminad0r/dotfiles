Got up this morning, with the blues walkin' like a man
Woke up this morning, with the blues walkin' like a man
Worried blues, give me your right hand

Blues, a low down shaky chill
Blues, a low down shaky chill


You ain't never had'um - hope you never will

Blues, that aching old heart disease
Blues, that aching old heart disease
Like consumption, killin' me by degree

It started raining, whoa, drown - drown my blues away
Started raining - drown my blues away
Going to the steel rail - gonna stay out there all day
