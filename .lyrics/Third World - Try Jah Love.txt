Music by Stevie Wonder
Lyrics by Stevie Wonder and Melody A. McCully

A lonely soul was I without direction
I didn't know which way that I had to go
I sought the clues to life's unanswered
Questions
My mind's heart had to know

I heard you call while wandering through
The darkness
I'd walk a million miles to find that endless
Voice
That speaks to me when I am in temptation
Echoing my choice

Then you said, "Seek ye shall find
I've been with you through all time"

(Chorus "A")
"And if you're thirsty I will quench you
With my love
And if you're hungry I will feed you
With my word
And all I ask of you is that you love as I do'

(Chorus "B")
"And if you lose your way I'll lead you
To my love
From a sinful life I'll cleanse you
In my love
For creation bears a witness of my love"
(Repeat once)

I know that
(Chorus "C")
You should know it's time for the world to
(Try Jah Love)

The only love that can bring peace is
(Jah, Jah Love)
So won't you try, try, try, try, try, try, try
Jah Love
Love, Love, Love, Love

I know that
Without it there'd be no tomorrow (Try Jah Love)
Who lifts broken hearts up from sorrow
(Try Jah Love)

So won't you try, try, try, try, try, try Jah Love
Love, Love, Love, Love

I know that
(Chorus "C" -repeat once)

You know that
(Chorus "C" -repeat once)
(Guitar Solo)

A timeless thought a touch of close encounter
Your love embraced me and took over my life
And now I'm new your strength has made me
Change my ways from wrong to right

Please Father please this world we live
Has faltered
Deliver us from all this evil and pain
God Bless the heart that loves unto his brother
Praising out your Name

Then he said, "Be not Afraid
Those who believe I will save"

(Chorus "A" -repeat)

I wonder
When will the world wake up and start to
(Try Jah Love)
People have to make up their mind to
(Jah, Jah Love)
So won't you try, try, try, try, try, try Jah Love
Love, Love, Love, Love

I know that
Once you begin you won't regret you
(Try Jah Love)
The ultimate life satisfaction (Jah, Jah Love)
So won't you try, try, try, try, try, try Jah Love
Love, Love, Love, Love

You know that
There's no excuse for no one not to
(Try Jah Love)
You'll be grateful you let inside you
(Jah, Jah Love)
So won't you try, try, try, try, try, try Jah Love
Love, Love, Love, Love

I know that
But Right is the only reason to (Try Jah Love)
The key to inner satisfaction (Jah, Jah Love)
So won't you try, try, try, try, try, try Jah Love
Love, Love, Love, Love

Try Jah Love
Jah, Jah Love

Try, try, try, try, try, try Jah Love
Love, Love, Love, Love
