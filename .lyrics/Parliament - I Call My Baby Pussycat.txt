Now I'm a torn cat and you're a pussycat
And I'm just sitting here licking my paw
Now I'm the torn cat and you're my little old pussycat
Why don't you scratch me on my back with your claw
Hey fellows your eyes may shine your teeth may grit
But none of my kitty-cat you're going to get

Put your foot on a rock
Good God
Well I don't know but I've been told
That dogs are man's best friend
But wild and warm is my baby's love
My kitten is where it's at

And I call my baby pussy cat
I spell it p-u-s-s-y-c-a-t
Said I call my baby pussy cat
I spell it p-u-s-s-y-c-a-t

Uninvited into my brain her body creeps at will
Making love unto my thoughts
That my purple mind can feel
Pussy-cat pussy-cat is her name
I'll tell you no lie
Pussy-cat pussy-cat is her name
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same

And I call my baby pussy cat
I spell it p-u-s-s-y-c-a-t
Said I call my pussy cat
I spell it p-u-s-s-y-c-a-t
