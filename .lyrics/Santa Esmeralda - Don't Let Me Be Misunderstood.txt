Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
Well don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I got my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
'Cause I love you

Baby, don't you know I'm just human
And I've got thoughts like any other man
And sometimes I feel myself alone, regretting
Some foolish thing, some foolish thing I've done

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Oh Lord, don't you let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be
Don't let me be misunderstood
No no no no no no...

(Solo)

Oh, come to me baby
Esmeralda
Come on baby
You're so sweet
My sweet Esmeralda, baby
Help me, help me, I love you
Oh don't play with me baby
Come on, back to me
Esmeralda
Oh baby, oh please, I love you baby
My sweet Esmeralda

(Solo)

Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
Well don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I've never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I got my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
'Cause I love you

Oh baby, don't you know I'm human
I have thoughts like any other man
And sometimes I feel myself alone, regretting
Some foolish thing, some foolish thing I've done

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

(Solo)

Oh Lord, don't you let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be
Don't let me be misunderstood
No no no no no no
