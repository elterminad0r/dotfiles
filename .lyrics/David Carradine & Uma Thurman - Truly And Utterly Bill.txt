David Carradine (Bill):
Now, when it comes to you and us I have a few unanswered questions. So before this tale of bloody revenge reaches it's climax, I'm going to ask you some questions and I want you to tell me the truth. However there in lies a delema. Because when it comes to the subject of me, I believe you are truly and utterly incapable of telling the truth. Especially to me. And least of all, to yourself. And when it comes to the subject of me, I am truly and utterly incapable of believing anything you say.

Uma Thurman (The Bride):
How do you suppose we solve this dilemma?

David Carradine (Bill):
Well, it just so happens, I have a solution.
