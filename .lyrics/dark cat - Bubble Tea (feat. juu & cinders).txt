Let's go to see the stars and the moon
I'll fly far into space as long as I am with you
The light in my bright eyes when you are near
The flutter I feel in my chest when you are here
I can't explain this kind of love
It pulls me to you, I want it, I can't get enough
So share this precious life with me
Just take my hand and let's enjoy the things that we'll see
