I'd like to dedicate this to all of the Creator's righteous children
I have some food in my bag for you
Not that edible food, the food you eat
No, I have some food for thought
Since knowledge is infinite, it has infinitely fell on me
So um

It was a stormy night
You know the kind where the lightning strike
And I was hanging out with some of my artsy friends
Ooh wee ooh wee ooh
The night was long, the night went on
People cooling out until the break of dawn
Incense was burning so I'm feeling right, aight

See, I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My ganny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't go around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got
I work at pleasing me 'cause I can't please you
And that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee doo wee do wee

And if you don't want to be down with me
You don't want to pick from my appletree
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my appletree
And if you don't want to be down with me
Then you don't want to pick from my appletree
And if you don't want to be down with me
You just don't want to be down

I have a hoe, and I take it everywhere I go
'Cause I'm planting seeds, so I reaps what I sow (y'know) y' know
Oh on and on, and on and on
My cipher keeps moving like a rolling stone
I can't control the soul flowing in me (ooh wee) ooh wee

See, I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My ganny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got
I work at pleasing me 'cause I can't please you
And that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee doo wee do wee

And if you don't want to be down with me
You don't want to pick from my appletree
And if you don't want to be down with me
You don't want to pick from my appletree
And if you don't want to be down with me
You don't want to pick from my appletree
And if you don't want to be down with me
You just don't want to be down

Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, ah
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Oh, oh

See, I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My ganny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got
I work at pleasing me 'cause I can't please you
And that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee doo wee do wee

And if you don't want to be down with me
You don't want to pick from my appletree
And if you don't want to be down with me
You dum dum diddy
And if you don't want to be down with me
You don't want to pick from my appletree
And if you don't want to be down with me
You just don't want to be down
(You just don't want to be down)
You just don't want to be down
(You just don't want to be down)

Oh, you just don't want to be down
Down, down, down
You just don't want to be down
Oh, you just don't want to be down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Be down, oh, oh no
You just don't want to be down
