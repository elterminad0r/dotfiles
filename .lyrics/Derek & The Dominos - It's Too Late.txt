It's too late, she's gone
It's too late, my baby's gone
Wish I had told her she was my only one
But it's too late, she's gone

It's a woman that cries
So I guess I have to dry my eyes
Yes, I will miss her more than anyone
But it's too late, she's gone

She's gone (she's gone), oh yeah she's gone (oh, she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone), my baby's gone (my baby’s gone)
She's gone (oh, she's gone), oh yeah she's gone (yeah, she's gone)
Where can my baby be?

And I wonder does she know
When she left me, it hurt me so
I need your love babe, please don't make me wait
Tell me it's not too late

She's gone (she's gone), yes she's gone (oh, she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone), my baby's gone (yeah she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone), oh yeah she's gone (oh, my baby’s gone)
Where can my baby be?

And I wonder does she know
When she left me, it hurt me so
I need your love babe, please don't make me wait
Tell me it's not too late
