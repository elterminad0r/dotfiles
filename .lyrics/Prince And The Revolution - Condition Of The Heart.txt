There was a girl in Paris
Whom he sent a letter to
Hoping she would answer back
Now wasn't that a fool

Hardy notion on the part of a
Sometimes lonely musician
Acting out a whim is only good
For a condition of the heart

There was a dame from London
Who insisted that he love her
Then left him for a real prince
From Arabia, now isn't that

A shame that sometimes money
Buys you everything and nothing
Love, it only seems to buy a
Terminal condition of the heart, oh

Oh, thinking about you driving me crazy
Oh, my friends all say it's just a phase
But oh, every day is a yellow day
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard

There was a woman from the ghetto
Who made funny faces just like
Clara Bow, how was I to know
That she would wear the same

Cologne as you and giggle the same
Giggle that you do?
Whenever I would act a fool
The fool with a condition of the heart

Oh, thinking about you driving me crazy
Oh, my friends all say it's just a phase
But oh, every single day is a yellow day
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard

(There was a girl) There was a girl in Paris
(Whom he sent a letter to) Whom he sent a letter to
(Hoping she would answer back)
She never answered back and now (wasn't that a foolhardy)
He's got a condition of the heart (notion)
