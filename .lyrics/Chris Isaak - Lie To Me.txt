There is a woman
Far over the sea
Standing and waiting
Praying for me

Here I lie sleeping
A girl by my side
Who am I hurting
Each time I lie?

Lie to me
Lie
Lie to me
Lie

There is a woman
Trying hard to be brave
The way that I hurt her
Has made her afraid

Things that I'm doing
Are breaking her heart
Still she's pretending
We'll never part

Lie to me
Lie
Lie to me
Lie

I don't care what people may say
I know everybody lies
I'm not trying to hurt my love
I'm only trying to get by

There is a woman
Far over the sea
Standing and waiting
Praying for me

Here I lie sleeping
A girl by my side
Who am I hurting
Each time I lie?

Lie to me
Lie
Lie to me
Lie

Lie to me
Lie
Lie to me
Lie
