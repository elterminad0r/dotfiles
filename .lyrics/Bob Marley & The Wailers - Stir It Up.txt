Stir it up
Little darling stir it up (come on baby)
Come on and stir it up
Little darling stir it up, whoa

It's been a long, long time (stir it together)
Since I've got you on my mind, whoa
And now you are here (stir it together)
I say it's so clear
To see what we can do, baby, just me and you

Come on and stir it up
Little darling stir it up
Come on baby
Come on and stir it up, yeah
Little darling stir it up, oh

Mmm, I'll push the wood, yeah (stir it together)
Blaze your fire
Then I'll satisfy your heart's desire (stir it together)
Said I'll stir it, yeah, every minute
All you got to do baby is keep it in it

And stir it up, come on
Little darling stir it up
I will catch this bait
Come on and stir it up, oh, oh
Little darling stir it up, oh

Mmm, and then quench me when I'm thirsty
Come and cool me down baby when I'm hot
Your recipe, darling, is so tasty
And you sure can stir your pot

So stir it up, oh
Little darling stir it up
Come on girl
Come on and stir it up, oh, ah
Little darling stir it up
Stir it baby, stir it
Come on, come on and stir it up, oh
Little darling stir it up
Stir it, stir it, stir it
