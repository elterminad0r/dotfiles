Well my temperature's rising and my feet on the floor
Twenty people rockin' and there wanna go more
Let me in baby, I don't know what you've got
But you'd better take it easy, this place is hot

So glad we made it
So glad we made it
You gotta

Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (Gimme gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin'
Everyday
Hey hey

Well I feel so good, everything is sellin' high
You'd better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
It's been a hard day and I don't know what to do
Wait a minute, baby, it can happen to you
And I'm

So glad we made it
So glad we made it
You gotta

Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (Gimme gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin'
Everyday

Well I feel so good, everybody's gettin' high
You'd better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
It's been a hard day, nothin' went too good
Now we're gonna relax, honey, everybody should

So glad we made it
So glad we made it
You gotta

Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (Gimme some lovin')
