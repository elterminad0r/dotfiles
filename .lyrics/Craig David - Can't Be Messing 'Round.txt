Uh Uh yeah, Craig David, It's another one
Gonna make ya make ya dance to this (X2)
This is how we do it one time
Into the year 2, 0 straight from 9, 9 (Come on)

One day minding my own business, girl from back won't keep her distance
She was all over me, just won't let it be (oh no)
So I said to her I've got a girl at home
This is so hard for me but you gotta leave me alone
She said she didn't want to listen to me
Knew exactly what she wanted to be, my baby
I must admit that she was getting to me
Waiting for me, wanting me to hold her oh so tightly

Together, forever, wherever (huh) whatever
She said she couldn't find anybody better
Wasn't gonna give up on me never, she said:
Ooh, your looking so fly every time you pass me by
I like the way you move your body
Girl I must admit you're looking real fit
Let's chill for a little bit
I know you wanna get with me, but girl you know I'm not free

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Come on let me hit it again
Come on let me sing it again
Won't pretend, can't be messing 'round with my girlfriend (X2)

It seems like everyday girl you wanna be calling me
And when I step outside you always follow me
You said that you were really feelin' sisqo's thong
About the thong tha' thong thong thong did I wanna see
And when you talk like that you know you're really tempting me
But I got a girl at home who'll do the same for me
And that's the way it's gotta be, gotta be so listen now lady:
Ooh, I like your profile, the way you talk and your smile
But you gotta understand lady, I'm not cheating on my baby
Ooh, you know this ain't right, I'm going home to my girl tonight
And I'm sorry that we couldn't get get it on
But the love for my girl's too strong

Girlfriend this love we got be golden (golden)
And you know you got me open (open)
Since the day we started talking
You and I've had this special little something (something)
When I wake up in the morning (yeah, yeah)
Girl it would be you I'd be calling (that's right)
Since I met you my phone bill be doubling
But girlfriend you know that money ain't a thing (ain't a thing)
With who me? The one and only C-R-A-I-G, come on
Now let me deliver this properly (yeah yeah)
So the world can see that I, ain't the type of guy
And why should I, make my girlfriend cry?
Can't deny the girl I met was real fly
But it's you that puts me on a natural high
So I just walked on by (ha ha), saying my oh my (yeah)
I ain't gon' let no other girl start troublin'
Lose something like you, you must be joking (come on)
