Apostles
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening...

Jesus
Why should you want to know?
Don't you mind about the future, don't you try to think ahead
Save tomorrow for tomorrow, think about today instead

Apostles
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening...

Jesus
I could give you facts and figures - even give you plans and forecasts
Even tell you where I'm going -

Apostles
When do we ride into Jerusalem?...

Jesus
Why should want you know?
Why are you obsessed with fighting times and fates you can't defy?
If you knew the path we're riding you'd understand it less than I

Apostles
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening...

Mary magdalene
Let me try to cool down your face a bit...

Jesus
Mary - mm - that is good
While you prattle through your supper - where and when and who and how
She alone has tried to give me what I need right here and now

Apostles
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening?...
