Rolling the ball, rolling the ball, rolling the ball to me
Rolling the ball, rolling the ball, rolling the ball to me

They arrived at an inconvenient time
I was hiding in a room in my mind
They made me look at myself
I saw it well
I'd shut the people out of my life

So now I take the opportunities
Wonderful teachers ready to teach me
I must work on my mind
For now I realize
Every one of us
Has a heaven inside

Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Them heavy people help me
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Rolling the ball, rolling the ball, rolling the ball to me
Rolling the ball, rolling the ball, rolling the ball to me

They open doorways that I thought were shut for good
They read me Gurdjieff and Jesu
They build up my body
Break me emotionally
It's nearly killing me
But what a lovely feeling

I love the whirling of the Dervishes
I love the beauty of rare innocence
We don't need no crystal ball
Don't fall for a magic wand
We humans got it all
We perform the miracles

Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Them heavy people help me
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling

Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Them heavy people help me
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling

Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Them heavy people help me
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Them heavy people help me
