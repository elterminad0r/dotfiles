I'm wearing fur pajamas
I ride a hot potato
It's tickling my fancy
Speak up, I can't hear you

Here on this mountaintop
I got some wild, wild life
I got some news to tell you
About some wild, wild life
Here come the doctor in charge
She's got some wild, wild life
Ain't that the way you like it
Living wild, wild

I wrestle with your conscience
You wrestle with your partner
Sitting on a windowsill
But he spends time behind closed doors

So check out mister businessman
He bought some wild, wild life
On the way to the stock exchange
He got some wild, wild life
Pick it up when he opens the door
He doing wild, wild life
I know it's the way you like it
Living wild, wild

Peace of mind
It's a piece of cake
Thought control
You get on board any time you like

Like sitting on pins and needles
Things fall apart, it's scientific

Sleeping on the Interstate
Getting wild, wild life
Checking in and checking out
I got 'em wild, wild life
Spending all of my money and time
Done too much wild, wild (life)
We wanna go and we go where we go
Ah, doing wild, wild life
I know it, that's how we start
Got some wild, wild life
Take a picture here in the daylight
And it's a wild, wild life
You've grown so tall, you've grown so fat
Wild, wild
And I know that's the way you like it
Living wild, wild, wild, wild
Life
