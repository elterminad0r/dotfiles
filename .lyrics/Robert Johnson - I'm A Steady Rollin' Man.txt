I'm a steady rollin' man
I roll both night and day
I'm a steady rollin' man
Hmmm hmmm I roll both night and day
But I haven't got no sweet woman
Hmm mmm boys to be rollin' this way

I'm the man that rolls
When icicles hangin' on the tree
I'm the man that rolls
When icicles hangin' on the tre
And now you hear me howlin, baby
Hmm hmmm mmm down on my bended knee

I'm a hard workin man
Have been for many years I know
I'm a hard workin man
Have been for many long years I know
And some cream puffs usin' my money
Ooh well babe, that'll never be no more
You can't give your sweet woman
Everything she wants in one time
Ooh hoo ooh
You can't give your sweet woman
Everything she wants in one time

Well boys, she get ramblin in her brain
Hmmm mmm mmm some other man on her mind

I'm a steady rollin' man
I roll both night and day
I'm a steady rollin' man
Hmmm hmmm I roll both night and day
But I haven't got no sweet woman
Hmm mmm boys to be rollin' this way

From Four Till Late
