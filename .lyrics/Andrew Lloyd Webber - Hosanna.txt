Crowd:
Hosanna
Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna
Hey Sanna Hosanna
Hey JC, JC won't you smile at me?
Sanna Hosanna
Hey Superstar

Caiaphas:
Tell the rabble to be quiet, we anticipate a riot.
This common crowd, is much too loud.
Tell the mob who sing your song that they are fools and they are wrong.
They are a curse. They should disperse.

Crowd:
Hosanna
Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna
Hey Sanna Hosanna
Hey JC, JC you're all right by me
Sanna Hosanna
Hey Superstar

Jesus:
Why waste your breath moaning at the crowd?
Nothing can be done to stop the shouting.
If every tongue were stilled
The noise would still continue.
The rocks and stone themselves would start to sing:

Crowd and Jesus:
Hosanna
Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna
Hey Sanna Hosanna

Crowd:
Hey JC, JC won't you fight for me?
Sanna Hosanna Hey Superstar

Jesus:
Sing me your songs,
But not for me alone.
Sing out for yourselves,
For you are bless-ed.
There is not one of you
Who can not win the kingdom.
The slow, the suffering,
The quick, the dead.

Crowd and Jesus:
Hosanna
Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna
Hey Sanna Hosanna

Crowd:
Hey JC, JC won't you die for me?
Sanna Hosanna Hey Superstar
