I'm on my way, it's you I have turned to
How many days have I to love you?

I got to say this is inside me yeah
I've got to have someone to guide me.

Hate it when you leave, hate it when you leave
Hate it when you're leaving me
Hate it when you leave, hate it when you leave, yeah yeah, yeah.

You're everywhere I go even though you're miles away
But I see, see your face everyday, oh and I love, I love it.

It's a hard game you play yeah.

Hate it when you leave, hate it when you leave
Hate it when you're leaving me
Oh hate it when you leave, hate it when you leave
Yeah I hate it when you're leavin' me
Hate it when you leave, hate it when you leave
Hate it when you're leaving me.

It's killing me, no arms around me, yeah
Living this way, so underhanded, yeah.

I gotta make you stay, I gonna habit.

Hate it when you leave, hate it when you leave
Hate it when you're leaving me
Hate it when you leave, hate it when you leave
Hate it when you're leavin' me
Hate it when you leave, hate it when you leave
Hate it when you're leaving me
