He realized that she was new to love
Naive in every way
Every school boy's fantasy she was
That's why he had to wait
If he poured his heart into a glass
And offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time
For the morning papers

They could take a walk down the oceanside
Make a wish every wave
They could find a carousel and ride
Or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe
Or just one star
Or just how far was the walk
For the morning papers

Why is age more than a number
When it comes to love?
Should we ask the ones who speculate
When they don't know what it's made of?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair?
Or should we ask The Man who wrote it there
In the morning papers?

Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair?
Or should we ask The Man
Who wrote it there in the morning papers?
