Men
Make way for Prince Ali!
Say hey, it's Prince Ali!

The Genie
Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you, let us through, it's a bright new star
Oh, come be the first on your block to meet his eye
Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums
Are you gonna love this guy!

Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa!
Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Sunday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie!

Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa!
Strong as ten regular men, definitely!
He faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali!

Men
He's got seventy-five golden camels
The Genie
Don't they look lovely June?

Women
Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three
The Genie
Fabulous, Harry, I love the feathers

When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Has he got a zoo?
I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie

Prince Ali, handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
That physique! How can I speak?
Weak at the knees
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your veil and prepare
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali

The Genie and Townspeople
He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys
(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)
And to view them he charges no fee
(He's generous, so generous)
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies
(Proud to work for him)
They bow to his whim, love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali...
Prince Ali!

Prince Ali, amorous he, Ali Ababwa!
Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why
He got dolled up and dropped by
With sixty elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions, a brass band and more
With his forty fakirs
His cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way... for Prince... Ali!
