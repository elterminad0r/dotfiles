I'm the edge, I'm the chic, I'm the taste
I'm larger than life with just a hint of lace
I'm the vanguard, I'm the heir, I'm the vogue
I'm the chichi, Ooh ee ee, I'm the man Ã  la mode

You think you know fashion,
Well, fashion's a stranger
You think fashion's your friend,
My friend, fashion is danger

(Posing) Posing at the bar
(Posing) Posing sitting down
(Posing) Posing in the distance
(Posing) Posing with my arm
(Posing) Posing with my leg
(Posing) Posing like a swan
(Posing) Posing for a portrait
Posing a threat!

Hey! Hey-Hey! Hey! Yeah, Ooh

You think you know fashion,
Well, fashion's a stranger
You think fashion's your friend,
My friend, fashion is danger
