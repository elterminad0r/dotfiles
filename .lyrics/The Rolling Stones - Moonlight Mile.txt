When the wind blows and the rain feels cold
With a head full of snow
With a head full of snow
In the window there's a face you know
Don't the nights pass slow
Don't the nights pass slow

The sound of strangers sending nothing to my mind
Just another mad, mad day on the road
I am just living to be lying by your side
But I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road

Made a rag pile of my shiny clothes
Gonna warm my bones
Gonna warm my bones
I got silence on my radio
Let the air waves flow
Let the air waves flow

Oh I am sleeping under strange, strange skies
Just another mad, mad day on the road
My dreams is fading down the railway line
I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road

I'm hiding sister and I'm dreaming
I'm riding down your moonlight mile
I'm hiding baby and I'm dreaming
I'm riding down your moonlight mile
I'm riding down you moonlight mile
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I'm hiding, sister, and I'm dreaming
I'm riding down your moonlight mile
I'm hiding, baby, and I'm dreaming
I'm riding down your moonlight mile
I'm riding down your moonlight mile

Let it go now, ooh
Come on up, baby
Yeah, let it go now
Yeah
Flow now, baby
Yeah, move on now, yeah

Hey

Yeah, I'm coming home
'Cause I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road
On down the road, down the road
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby
