Aiyo, I wanna dedicate this song right here to O-Ren Ishii
Half Chinese/Half Japane-see, Half American and yo
Oh what a specie, a feminine perfection
She got the sinister cat eyes and little freckles on her complexion
Cheaper than Yakuza, but she's wicked like Medusa
And she got Crazy 88 killers that'll slice right through ya
Quick to chop a head off then wipe the blood off
A long range sniper shot she bust, never let a dud off
You got a minute to pray and a second to die
You can see the image of the devil reflectin' inside her eye
But since she was a little girl, yo, she never would cry
She seen so much tragedy, let me explain to you why
She grew up on the military base, where she had to face
The brutality of her mother and her father being erased
The blood drops from her tear drops, on her cheek you seen her smear spots
She solomly watched, as the shogun sliced through her dear pops
Through his thick skull, yeah she's viscius like a pit bull
And when it comes to hatred and revenge she got a shit full
Revenge is the fire that burns inside your soul

Aiyo, she's been busting up knee caps son since the age of 11
But fuckin' her enemy to death, that was her favorite weapon
And in death you paid in hell Boy it can't be paid in heaven
You better get down on your knees son and start praying to the reverend
Bon Appetite, Boy revenge is so sweet
Especially when it's served on a cold dish
But she has no wish but to cut yo day short like the winter solstice
And the chance to receive a slight bit of mercy from her was hopeless
Oren Ishii, half Chinese, half Japane-see, half American
Oh, what a species
