The gypsy woman told my mother
Before I was born
You got a boy child's comin'
He gonna be a son of a gun
He gonna make pretty womens
Jump and shout
Then the world wanna know
What this all about

But you know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
Well, you know I'm the hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

I got a black cat bone
I got a mojo too
I got the John the Conqueror root
I'm gonna mess with you
I'm gonna make you girls
Lead me by my hand
Then the world'll know
I'm the hoochie coochie man

But you know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
Well, you know I'm the hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

On the seven hour
On the seven day
On the seven month
The seven doctors say
He was born for good luck
And that you'll see
I got seven hundred dollars
And don't you mess with me

But you know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
Well, you know I'm the hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here
