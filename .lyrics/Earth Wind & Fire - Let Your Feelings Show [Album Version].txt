Woke up Sunday morning
Feeling out of tune
Wrapped my eyes around you
Love came in the room

Baby (baby)
Gonna let my feelings show (gonna let my feelings show)
Every day (every day)
Gonna learn to love you more (haha)

Laughing into midnight
Lover being my guide
We approach the morning
Feeling good inside

Baby (oh babe)
Gonna let my feelings show (gonna let my feelings show)
Every day (yeah, yeah)
Gonna learn to love you more (huh)

Paying dues and changes
Living day to day
Love is necessary
To help you find the way

Baby (yeah, yeah)
Gonna let my feelings show (gonna let my feelings show)
Every day (every day)

Try not to hide
What you feel deep inside
If you care, you must dare
To be free as the air (air)

Fairy tales and stories
That we fail to see
We will tell the story
Of reality

Baby (baby)
Gonna let my feelings show (gonna let my feelings show)
Every day (every day)
Gonna learn to love you more

Tingle in our heartbeat
Rapture on the cloud
When softer words are spoken
Action speaks out loud

Baby (yeah, yeah)
Gonna let my feelings show (gonna let my feelings show)
Every day (every day)

Try not to hide
What you feel deep inside
If you care, you must dare
To be free as the air

Oh, let your feelings
Gotta let your feelings
Yeah, hey

Feeling high
Feeling good
Yeah

Let your feelings show (let your feelings show)
Every day, you've got to let your feelings show, ow
Let your feelings show (let your feelings show)
Every day, you've got to let your feelings show, ow
