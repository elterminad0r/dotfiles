Early this mornin'
When you knocked upon my door
Early this mornin', ooh
When you knocked upon my door
And I said, "Hello, Satan"
I believe it's time to go"

Me and the Devil
Was walkin' side by side
Me and the Devil, ooh
Was walkin' side by side
And I'm goin' to beat my woman
Until I get satisfied

She say you don't see why
That you will dog me 'round
(Spoken:) Now, babe, you know you ain't doin' me right, don'cha
She say you don't see why, ooh
That you will dog me 'round
It must-a be that old evil spirit
So deep down in the ground

You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
(Spoken:) Baby, I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and gone
You may bury my body, ooh
Down by the highway side
So my old evil spirit
Can catch a Greyhound bus and ride
