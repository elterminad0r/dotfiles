Hey

It's hard to deny
We do our job, we do it right
We are the Million Minion March
And we don't die, we multiply

We work for Gru
We work for Gru
We work for Gru
We work for Gru

It's hard to deny
We do our job, we do it right
We are the million minion march
And we don't die, we multiply

We work for Gru
We work for Gru
We work for Gru
We work for Gru

We can take whatever you need
We got skill, precision, and speed
We are supervillain assistants
We work for the world's best thief
Will they trust a faithful staff
And Nefario's best sidekick
We promise not to laugh
And you know this who we ride with

We work for Gru
Friend to us maybe not to you
Gru
G to the R, to the U
We're doin' what love
And we're good at what we does
See those Minions in that house
Now there's all the rising plans

It's hard to deny
We do our job, we do it right
We are the million minion march
And we don't die, we multiply

We work for gru
We work for Gru
We work for Gru
We work for Gru

A laser under the seas
Or a rocket to the moon
Or a tiny traveling robot
We can have it for you soon

A nice invisible suit with matching anti-gravity boots
No one lacks for what we've made
Yeah, I was thinkin' I could really use a raise

We work for Gru
Friend to us maybe not to you
Gru
And what do we think about Vector?
Boo!

Say Gru is who we love
And we're doin' what we does
Got those over rising plans

Hey who would work for Gru
Besides that, who would steal the moon
That's such a silly thing to do
And if you sing it's over you

I'm stealin' the moon
I'm stealin' the moon
I'm stealin' the moon
I'm stealin' the moon

And they, are with, me, every day
The work, so hard, sometimes, they play
I don't, understand, what they say
But nor do you
It's something new

Hey who would work for Gru
Besides that, who would steal the moon
That's such a silly thing to do
And if you sing it's over you

I'm stealin' the moon
I'm stealin' the moon
I'm stealin' the moon
I'm stealin' the moon
Yeah
