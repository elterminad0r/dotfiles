Loretta broke my heart in a letter
She told me she was leaving and her life would be better
Joan broke it off over the phone
After the tone she left me alone
Jen said she'd never ever see me again
When I saw her again, she said it again
Jan met another man
Lisa got amnesia, just forgot who I am
Felicity said there was no electricity
Emily, no chemistry
Fran ran, Bruce turned out to be a man
Flo had to go, I couldn't go with the flow
Carol Brown just took a bus out of town...
But I'm hoping that you'll stick around

"He doesn't cook or clean, he's not good boyfriend material!"
We can eat cereal.
"He'll lose interest fast, his relationships never last!"
Shut up girlfriends from the past!
"Says he'll do one thing and then he goes and does another!"
Oh, who organized all my ex-girlfriends into a choir, and got them to sing?
Who? Who?
"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah..."
Mmm, shut up!
"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah..."
Shut up, girlfriends from the past

Mimi will no longer see me
Brittany, Brittany hit me
Paula, Persephone, Stella, and Stephanie
There must be fifty ways that lovers have left me
Carol Brown just took a bus out of town...

Love is a delicate thing, it could just float away on the breeze.
"He said the same thing to me."
How can you ever know if I'm the right person in this world?
"He means he looks at other girls."
Love is a mystery, it does not follow a rule.
"The guy is a fool. He'll always be a boy,
He's a man who never grew up."
I thought I told you to shut u-u-up!
"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah..."
Mona, you told me you were in a coma.
"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah..."
Tiffany, you said that you had an epiphany.
"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah..."
Mmm, would you like a little cereal?
"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah..."
Who organized this choir of ex-girlfriends?
Was it you Carol Brown, was it you Carol Brown?

Carol Brown just took a bus out of town,
But I'm hoping that you'll stick around...

Stick around, stick around
Do do, do do, stick around
Do do, do do do do, stick around
