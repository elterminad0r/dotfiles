A race of angels bound with one another
A dish of dollars laid out for all to see
A tower room at Eden Rock, his golf at noon for free
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me

His lady's achin' to bring a body down
She daily preaches on where she wants to be
An evening with a movie queen, a face we all have seen
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me

A case of aces done up loose for dealin'
A piece of island cooling in the sea
The whole of time we gain or lose and power enough to choose
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Mmm, Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Yeah, Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
