Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl
Her eyes were hazel
And her nose was slightly curved
We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel
It's on the ocean, I guess you know it well
It took a starry night to steal my breath away
Down on the water front
Her hair all drenched in spray

Hannah baby was a honey of a girl
Her eyes were hazel
And her teeth were slightly curved
She took my guitar and she began to play
She sang a song to me
Stuck right in my brain

You're just a memory
Of a love that used to be
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to mean so much to me

She got a mind of her own
And she use it well, yeah
Well, she's one of a kind
She's got a mind
She got a mind of her own, yeah
And she use it mighty fine

She drove a pick-up truck
Painted green and blue
The tires were wearing thin
She turned a mile or two
When I asked her where she headed for
"Back up to Boston, I'm singing in a bar"
I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge
My nerves are shot already
The road ain't all that smooth
Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone
I keep on a feeling that's gnawing at my bones

You're just a memory
Just a memory of a love that used to mean so much to me
Just a memory, you're just a memory
Just a memory of a love that used to mean so much to me, yeah
You're just a memory, girl, you're just a memory
And it used to mean so much to me, yeah
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
You're just a memory of a love that used to mean so much to me  (So much to me)

She got a mind of her own
And she use it well, yeah
Mighty fine, 'cause she's one of a kind
She got a mind of her own, she's one of a kind
And she use it well

On the seventh day, my eyes were all a glaze
We've been ten thousand miles
Been in fifteen states
Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind
I hit the bottle and I hit the sack and cried
What's all this laughter on the twenty-second floor
It's just some friends of mine
And they're busting down the door
Been a lonely night at the Memory Motel

You're just a memory, girl, just a memory
And it used to mean so much to me
You're just a memory, girl, you're just a memory
And it used to mean so much to me
You're just a memory, girl, you're just a memory
And it used to mean so much to me
You're just a memory of a love that used to mean so much to me  (So much to me)

Oooh, she got a mind of her own
And she use it well, yeah
Well, she's one of a kind
