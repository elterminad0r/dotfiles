Wild skies
Full moon and thoughts collide
We look for answers in those catatonic, bloodshot eyes
The eyes that vomit are the ones that are in love
Those aren't tears,
They're just bad bad blood

Just bad bad blood

Wild lives
The big surprise
We get our clues from what
The funhouse mirrors authorize
A ray of thought turns happy endings into mud
Where there's denial, there's bad blood

Do you remember the strain?
Do you remember the pain?
Do you remember the cause or the blame?
Bad Blood!
Do you remember need?
Do you remember lust?
Do you surrender your greed or your trust?
Bad Blood!

Wild eyes
He's finally come alive
How'd all things mediocre
Wind up all things all the time
A steady stream of madness
Rises to a flood
The clock is ticking for bad blood

Do you remember the strain?
Do you remember the pain?
Do you remember the cause or the blame?
Bad Blood!
Do you remember need?
Do you remember lust?
Do you surrender your greed or your trust?
Bad Blood!
