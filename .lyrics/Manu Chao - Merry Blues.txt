So many nights
With your shadow in my bed
So many nights
Baby, you whisper in my head
So many nights
Sing along the merry blues
So many nights...
I told you once
I told you twice
The merry blues...
I told you once
I told you twice
The merry blues...
The merry blues
I cannot sleep
Haunted by your pretty body
I cannot sleep
I want the world set on fire
So many nights
Can't keep from going down lose...

I told you once
I told you twice
The merry blues...
I told you once
I told you twice
The merry blues...
The merry blues, the merry blues...

Hello nadina do you do do do do do
I feel so happy when I see see see see you

You make me sing like a doubadoubad...
I know you like it like a zoumbouzoumbou...

Hello nadina do you do do do do do
I feel the moody like to picky picky you
I told you once
I told you twice
The merry blues...

I know you like it like a rubadub stylee
I know you like the marjiuana smoking

So many nights
I sing along the merry blues
So many nights.
Can't keep from going down lose...
The merry blues...
