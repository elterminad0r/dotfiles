[00:02.79]Any way the wind blows is-a fine with me
[00:10.34]Any way the wind blows, it don't matter to me
[00:18.41]'Cause I'm through with-a fussin' and-a fightin' with-a you
[00:22.36]I went out and found a woman who is gonna be true
[00:26.03]She makes me oh so happy now, I'm never ever blue
[00:31.29]Any way the wind blows,
[00:35.11]Any way the wind blows,
[00:38.78]Any way the wind blows
[00:42.46]She's my heart and soul and she loves me tenderly
[00:51.30]Now my story can't be told just how good she is to me
[00:58.22]Yes, she treats me like she loves me and she never makes me cry
[01:02.25]I'm gonna stick with her till the day I die
[01:05.97]She's not like you baby, she would never ever lie
[01:11.06]Any way the wind blows,
[01:14.91]Any way the wind blows,
[01:18.62]Any way the wind blows
[01:51.01]Any way the wind blows,
[01:54.96]Any way the wind blows,
[01:58.53]Any way the wind blows
[02:02.43]Now that I am free from the troubles of the past
[02:09.80]Took me much too long to see that our romance couldn't last
[02:18.51]I'm gonna go away and leave you standing at the door
[02:22.16]I'll tell you pretty baby I won't be back no more
[02:25.81]'Cause you don't even know what love is for
[02:31.01]Any way the wind blows,
[02:34.94]Any way the wind blows,
[02:38.66]Any way the wind blows
