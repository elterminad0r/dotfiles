It's all about identity,
Construction of a family
Of difference and simile,
What I give you and you give me.

It's all about identity,
This tribal sense of dignity,
Of tolerance and unity,
Of prejudice and bigotry.

It's all about identity
A web of who we'd like to be,
Let's cut and paste our memory:
A dark and timeless industry.

It's all about identity
A strength and solidarity,
A dazed, confused desire to find
A place and time in history.

It's all about identity
Or how the sheer majority
Impose a predetermined badge
And wait to judge you silently.

It's all about identity,
A retrospective odyssey,
But where I live and who I meet
Are stronger in defining me.
