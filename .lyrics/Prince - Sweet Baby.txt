Close ur eyes, sweet baby
Now don't you cry
Everybody gets their heart broke, sweet baby
Sometimes
So he left u 4 another fool
Yes, a fool
4 loving him from the start
Ask urself what's more important
Him or the broken pieces of ur heart?
Sweet baby

Stand tall, sweet baby
Now don't you fall
U ain't the only 1 getting beat down
It happens 2 us all
The road you choose to walk in this life
Is the 1 that leads in2 the next
So, sweet baby, stall tall
Stand tall
Sweet baby

Hold ur tears back now
Better days gone come ur way soon, oh yes sweet baby

Those things that they would have you do

How can you sleep knowing that you and a fool
Sing in the same key?
