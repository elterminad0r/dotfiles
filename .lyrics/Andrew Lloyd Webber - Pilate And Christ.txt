Pilate
Who is this broken man cluttering up my hallway?
Who is this unfortunate?

Soldier
Someone Christ, King of the Jews.

Pilate
Oh, so this is Jesus Christ, I am really quite surprised.
You look so small,
Not a king at all.
We all know that you are news,
But are you king? King of the Jews?

Jesus
That's what you say.

Pilate
What do you mean by that?
That is not an answer.
You're deep in trouble friend,
Someone Christ, King of the Jews.
How can someone in your state be so cool about your fate?
An amazing thing, this silent king.
Since you come from Galilee, then you need not come to me.
You're Herod's race! You're Herod's case!

MOB
Ho-ho Sanna Heysanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna
Heysanna Ho and how
Hey JC, JC please explain to me,
You had everything. Where is it now?
