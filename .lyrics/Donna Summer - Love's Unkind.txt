Well, I see him every morning
In the schoolyard before the school bell rings
And when he passes in the hallway
Well, he doesn't seem to notice me
He's got a crush on my best friend
But she don't care 'cause she loves someone else
I'm standing on the outside
Not the inside where I wanna be

Love's unkind
Love's unkind
Love's unkind
Love's unkind
'Cause he's not mine

Just the other day
I was praying he would give me a chance
Hoping he would choose me
For his partner for the high school dance
I was standing outside the class
But it wasn't me, but my best friend he asked
I went running back inside
Teary-eyed and left the two of them behind

Love's unkind
Love's unkind
Love's unkind
Love's unkind
'Cause he's not mine

Oh, how I love him so
But I can't even let him know
'Cause he loves my best friend
But she don't care, she loves someone else
And I asked my mama, and she said
"Love's unkind, love's so unkind"
She said, "Just keep in mind
'Cause you may find love's unkind"

Love's unkind
Love's unkind
Love's unkind
Love's unkind

Why must life treat me so
Why do I have to love him so
