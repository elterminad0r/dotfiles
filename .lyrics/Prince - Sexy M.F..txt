In a word or two, it's you I wanna do
No, not your body, your mind, you fool
Come here, baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker

We're all alone in a villa on the Riviere
That's in France on the south side, in case you care
Out of all your friends I wanna be the closest
That's why I tell you things, so you'll be the moistest
When it comes to life, to be this man's wife
You got to be well educated on the subject of fights
I mean prevention of
In other words it's R-E-A-L meaning of this thing called love
Are you up on this
If so, then you can get up off a hug and a kiss

Come here, baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker
Come here, baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker

We need to talk about things, tell me what you do
Tell me what you eat, I might cook for you
See, it really don't matter 'cause it's all about me and you
Ain't no one else around
I'm even with the blindfold, gagged and bound
I don't mind
See, this ain't about sex
It's all about love, being in charge of this life and the next
Why all the cosmic talk
I just want you smarter than I'll ever be when we take that walk

Come here, baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker
Come here, baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker

Horns, stand please
I like it, I like it

You seem perplexed, I haven't taken you yet
Can't you see I'm harder than a man can get
I got wet dreams coming out of my ears
I get hard if the wind blows your cologne near me
But I can take it 'cause I want the whole nine
This ain't about the body, it's about the mind

Come here, baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker
Come here baby, yeah, ooh
You sexy motherfucker

Tommy Barbarella in the house
Scrub the dishes

Come here Tommy, yeah
Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy
Levi, Levi, fly

Oh man, let's give 'em some more good shit

I like it, I like it
Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass
Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass
Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass
Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass

Guard your folks and get your daughter
The sexy motherfucker's so fine, I could drink her bathwater
A long, leggy five foot eight
Packing an ass as tight as a grape
I want to spit some game but I said to myself, hmm, just conversate (yeah)
'Cause I'm usually quite the calm one (come on)
You never found me out prowling, boy, I'm just havin' fun
But I'm happy to change my state of mind for this behind
I bet that if you threw that ass into the air it would, turn into sunshine

Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass
Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass
Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass
Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass

Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass
Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass
Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass
Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass
