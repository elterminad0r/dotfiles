Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now?
You got someone to blame

You say one love, one life (one life)
It's one need in the night
One love (one love), get to share it
Leaves you, darling, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well it's too late, tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One...

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Well, did I ask too much? More than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
'Cause if we hurt each other
Then we'd do it again

You said
Love is a temple
Love is a higher law
Love is a temple
Love is a higher law
You ask for me to enter
But then you make me crawl
And I can't keep holding on
To what you've got
'Cause all you got is hurt

One love
One blood
One life
You've got to do what you should
One life
With each other
Sisters and my brothers
One life
But we're not the same
We get to
Carry each other
Carry each other

One...
One love
