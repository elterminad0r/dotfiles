What if half the things ever said
Turned out to be a lie
How will you know the truth?
If you were given all the answers
And you stopped to wonder why
But how will you know the truth?

Everybody's got a right to love
Everybody's got a right to lie
But the choice you make it ain't no piece of cake
It ain't no motherfuckin' piece of pie

What if time's only reason?
Was to give us all something to fear?
And if so you all, the end of the journey's so clear
Questionaire, what did you stand for?
Questionaire, who did you save?
When it gets right down to wait a minute
When it gets right down to the nitty of the gritty
When it gets right down to it you take more than you gave

Everybody's got a right to love
Everybody's got a right to lie
But the choice you make it ain't no piece of cake
It ain't no motherfuckin' piece of pie

Mmmm oh
Got to (Going to?) tell the truth you all
Got to tell the truth
Got to tell the truth you all
Got to tell the truth
Got to tell the truth you all
Got to tell the truth

If there was just one day
That everybody tell the truth
We'd all trade bank accounts and move to back to Neptune
