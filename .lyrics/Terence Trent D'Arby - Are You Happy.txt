I know that it's your own life
I tell you this
With an eye on your future
Yes I know
Mind my own business
But I am here
As an aid and a comfort
I can see what you're going through
'Cause we've all been there before
But all in all
Here's that I'm wondering
I want to know
Are you happy?
Look me in the eye
And answer my question
I want to know
Are you happy?
Or are you afraid
Of decisions that you need to make?

I know that life's about choices
But making a wrong one
Will not stop the world
When in doubt just live the questions
And someday you will grow into the answer
You're allowed as many mistakes
As you need to learn and move on
Well, well, well now ponder this
'Cause my heart is ringing a bell
I want to know
Are you happy?
I'm coming to you from Heartbeat Avenue
I wanna know
Are you happy,
Or are you running
From decisions that you need to make?

I wanna know
Are you happy?
Can I be of service?
What can I do to help you now?
I know life's a bitch sometimes
But you got to take it in
Chew it up
And spit it out again
You got to accept the pain
You can't get around it
You can't get under it
But you can get over it
