Twenty seconds on the back time
I feel you're on the run
Never lived too long to make right
I see you're doing fine

And when I get that feeling
I can no longer slide
I can no longer run, oh no no
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer hide
For it's no longer fun, oh no no

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you

What I am is what you want of me
Yeah, now that I'm not there
I took the tables away from you
It's turned and I don't care

And when I get that feeling
I can no longer slide
I can no longer run, oh no no
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer hide
For it's no longer fun, oh no no

Yeah, you can say what you want (and you can say what you want)
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
And you can tell me your reasons (and you can tell me your reasons)
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you

Yeah, you can say what you want (and you can say what you want)
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
And you can tell me your reasons (and you can tell me your reasons)
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you

I've said goodnight, try to sleep tight
Oh, just dream of me
Go close your eyes cause I've closed mine
The sun will shine from time to time
Oh, when you dream of me, yeah

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you

Yeah, you can say what you want (when I get that feeling)
But it won't change my mind (I can no longer slide)
I'll feel the same about you (I can no longer run, oh no no)
And you can tell me your reasons (and when I get that feeling)
But it won't change my feelings(I can no longer hide)
I'll feel the same about you (for it's no longer fun, oh no no)

Yeah, you can say what you want (when I get that feeling)
But it won't change my mind (I can no longer slide)
I'll feel the same about you (I can no longer run, oh no no)
And you can tell me your reasons (and when I get that feeling)
But it won't change my feelings(I can no longer hide)
I'll feel the same about you (for it's no longer fun, oh no no)
