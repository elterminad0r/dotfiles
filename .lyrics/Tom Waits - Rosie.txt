Well, I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn
Nobody's up except the moon and me
And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree
All that you left me was a melody

Rosie, why do you evade?
Rosie, how can I persuade?
Rosie

And the moon's all up, full and big
Apricot tips in an indigo sky
And I've been loving you, Rosa, since the day I was born
And I'll love you, Rosie, till the day I die

Rosie, why do you evade?
Rosie, how can I persuade?
Rosie

Rosie, why do you evade?
Rosie, how can I persuade?
Rosie

And I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn
Nobody's up except the moon and me
And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree
All that you left me was a melody

Rosie, why do you evade?
Rosie, how can I persuade?
Rosie
