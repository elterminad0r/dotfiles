Well, I remember every little thing
As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Come on! Hold on tight!
Well, come on! Hold on tight!

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep, dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Ain't no doubt about it, we were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby, got to go out and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed

Baby don'cha hear my heart?
You got it drowning out the radio
I've been a-waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun
And I gotta let you know
No, you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes, I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right
Well, I wanna make your motor run

And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Come on! Hold on tight!
Well, come on! Hold on tight!

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep, dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep, dark night
Paradise by the dashboard light

You got to do what you can
And let Mother Nature do the rest
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely

We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night
We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night
We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night
We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way and tonight's the night

Okay, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here. Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth. There's the wind-up, and there it is: a line shot up the middle. Look at him go, this boy can really fly. He's rounding first and really turning it on now. He's not letting up at all, he's gonna try for second. The ball is bobbled out in the center and here comes the throw and what a throw! He's gonna slide in head-first, here he comes... he's out. No, wait, safe! Safe at second base! This kid really makes things happen out there. Batter steps up to the plate. Here's the pitch, and he's going, and what a jump he's got, he's trying for third. Here's the throw... It's in the dirt, safe at third. Holy cow, stolen base. He's taking a pretty big lead out there, almost daring them to try and pick him off. The pitcher glances over, winds-up and it's bunted. Bunted down the third base line and the suicide squeeze is on. Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close. Here's the throw, here's the play at the plate. Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it...

Stop right there!
I gotta know right now

I couldn't take it any longer
Lord! I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me
Like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my God
And on my mother's grave
That I would love you till the end of time
I swore I would love you till the end of time

So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive

I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
That's all that I can do, ooh, ooh
Praying for the end of time
So I can end my time with you

And it was long ago and it was far away
And it was so much better than it is today

It was long ago and it was far away
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And it was so much better than it is today
And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
It was long ago and it was far away
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And it was so much better than it is today
And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
It was long ago and it was far away
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And it was so much better than it is today
And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
