When the things you know are right
Are far from what they seem
When the past becomes the future
And time becomes a dream
When the light of God
Is the only thing in life that will redeem
Welcome, welcome 2 the dawn
When the voices you hear commands U
2 entertain thee absurd
When you do the action unlocks
Thee apocalypse of that you've heard of
When the day lies before U
Seems the darkest in a word
Welcome, welcome 2 the dawn

Every pieces a puzzle and every name a clue
Every charge you make is karma
So be careful what you do
Welcome, welcome 2 the dawn

(Welcome 2 the dawn) (Thank U)
