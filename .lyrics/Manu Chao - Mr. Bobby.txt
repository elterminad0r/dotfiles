Sometimes I dream about reality
Sometimes I feel so gone
Sometimes I dream about a wild wild world
Sometimes I feel so lonesome

Hey Bobby Marley
Sing something good to me, yeah!
This world go crazy
It's an emergency, woh!

Tonight I dream about fraternity
Tonight I say: one day
One day my dreams will be reality
Like Bobby said to me

Hey Bobby Marley
Sing something good to me, yeah!
This world go crazy
It's an emergency, woh!

Sing something good to me
This world go crazy
It's an emergency, woh!

Tonight I watch through my window
And I can't see no lights
Tonight I watch through my window
And I can't see no rights
