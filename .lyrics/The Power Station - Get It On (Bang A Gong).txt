Well, you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black, don't look back
And I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah

Well you're slim and you're weak
You got the teeth of the hydra upon you
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl

Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on
Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on

Well, you're built like a car
You got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're built like a truck, oh yeah

Well, you're an untamed youth
That's the truth
With your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl

Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on
Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on

Whoo, get it on
Bang a gong, get it on
Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on

Well you're windy and wild
You got the blues in your shoes
And your stockings
You're windy and wild, oh yeah

You're built like a car
You got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl

Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on
Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on

Get it on
Get it on
Bang a gong

Whoo, get it on
Bang a gong, get it on
Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on

Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on
Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on

Whoo, get it on
(Bang a gong, get it on) Get it on
Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on

Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on
Get it on
Bang a gong, get it on
Get it on
