Now they lay his body down
Sad old men who run this town
I still recall the way
He led the charge and saved the day
Blue blood and reign
I can hear the bugle playin'

We've seen the last of Good King Richard
Ring out the past, his name lives on and on
Roll out the bones and raise up your pitcher
Raise up your glass to Good King John,  oh, ho

While he plundered far and wide
All his starving children cried
And though we sung his fame
We all went hungry just the same
He meant to shine
To the end o' the line

We've seen the last of Good King Richard
Ring out the past, his name lives on and on
Roll out the bones and raise up your pitcher
Raise up your glass to Good King John

Hey!

And though we sung his fame
We all went hungry just the same
He meant to shine
To the end of the line

We've seen the last of Good King Richard
Ring out the past, his name lives on and on
Roll out the bones and raise up your pitcher
Raise up your glass to Good King John
Raise up your glass to Good King John
Raise up your glass to Good King John
