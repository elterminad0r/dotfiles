When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down
Bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
A king with no crown
King with no crown

I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby

I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his crooked ways
I've learned love is like a brick
You can build a house or sink a dead body

(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down
Bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
A king with no crown
King with no crown

I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Ew...
In the most Biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offensed, or wear ear condom next time

I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue and
Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas, Juda-ah-ah
