My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Well, no one told me about her
The way she lied
Well, no one told me about her
How many people cried

My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Well, no one told me about her
The way she lied
Well, no one told me about her
How many people cried

But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know? Why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there

Well, no one told me about her
Well no one told me about her
How many people cried

But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know? Why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there

She's not there
She's not there
