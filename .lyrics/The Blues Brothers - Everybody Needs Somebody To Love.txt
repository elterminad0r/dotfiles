One two, one two three four

We're so glad to see so many of you lovely people here tonight. And we would especially like to welcome all the representatives of Illinois' law enforcement community who have chosen to join us here in the Palace Hotel Ballroom at this time. We do sincerely hope that you all enjoy the show and please remember, people, that no matter who you are and whatever you do to live, thrive and survive. There are still some things that make us all the same; you, me, them, everybody! Everybody!

Sometimes I feel
I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me
I never, never, never have a place to hide

I need you!
