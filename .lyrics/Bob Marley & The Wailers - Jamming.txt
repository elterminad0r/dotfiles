Ooh yeah
All right

We're jamming
I wanna jam it with you
We're jamming, jamming
And I hope you like jamming too

Ain't no rules, ain't no vow
We can do it anyhow
I and I will see you through
'Cause everyday we pay the price
We're the living sacrifice
Jamming 'til the jam is through

We're jamming
To think that jamming was a thing of the past
We're jamming
And I hope this jam is gonna last

No bullet can stop us now
We neither beg nor we won't bow
Neither can be bought nor sold
We all defend the right
Jah Jah children must unite
For life is worth much more than gold

We're jamming (jamming, jamming, jamming)
And we're jamming in the name of the Lord
We're jamming (jamming, jamming, jamming)
We're jamming right straight from yard

Singing
Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion
And rules all creation

Yeah, we're
We're jamming (Bop-chu-waa)
Bop-chu-wa-wa-wa
We're jamming (Bop-chu-waa)
See,
I wanna jam it with you
We're jamming (jamming, jamming, jamming)
And Jamdown hope you're jamming too

Jah knows how much I've tried
The truth I cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
True love that now exists
Is the love I can't resist
So jam by my side

We're Jamming (jamming, jamming, jamming), yeah-eah-eah
I wanna jam it with you
We're jamming, we're jamming, we're jamming, we're jamming
We're jamming, we're jamming, we're jamming, we're jamming
Hope you like jamming too

We're jamming, we're jamming (jamming)
We're jamming, we're jamming (jamming)
I wanna (I wanna jam it with you) I wanna
I wanna jam with you now

We're jamming, we're jamming (hope you like jamming too)

And I hope you like jamming, I hope you like jamming
'Cause (I wanna jam it with you) I wanna jam it with you

I like, I hope you, I hope you like jamming too

I wanna jam it
I wanna jam it
