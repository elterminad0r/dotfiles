A world become one of salads and sun 
Only a fool would say that 
A boy with a plan, a natural man 
Wearing a white Stetson hat 
Unhand that gun, begone 
There's no one to fire upon 
If he's holdin' it high 
He's tellin' a lie 

I heard it was you 
Talkin' 'bout a world 
Where all is free 
It just couldn't be 
And only a fool would say that 

The man in the street draggin' his feet 
Don't wanna hear the bad news 
Imagine your face there is his place 
Standing inside his brown shoes 
You do his nine to five 
Drag yourself home half alive 
And there on the screen 
A man with a dream 

I heard it was you 
Talkin' 'bout a world 
Where all is free 
It just couldn't be 
And only a fool would say that 

Anybody on the street has murder in his eyes 
You feel no pain 
And you're younger than you realize 
Only a fool would say that
Only a fool

I heard it was you 
Talkin' 'bout a world 
Where all is free 
It just couldn't be 
And only a fool would say that
Only a fool would say that
Only a fool would say that
