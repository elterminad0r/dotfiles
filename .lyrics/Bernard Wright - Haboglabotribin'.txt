Have you been to Wonderland?
There's lots of toys and ice cream stands
All the rides are fifty cents
So take those ladies, all you gents
Haven't had this much fun anywhere
To go back home, I just don't care
Me leave this place? No I don't dare!
Haboglabotribin'!

Tilt-a-Whirl and Wonder Wheel
Are all those things that you can feel
Take your time so you can stay
Having laughs and fun all day
If you like to feel speed
The roller coaster is your need
All other rides are chicken feed!
Haboglabotribin'!

Haboglabotribin' is an amusement park
It's there for you from dawn to dark
Lots of games that you can bid
A nice clean place to take your kid
Lights that sparkle all so bright
I love to see them all at night
My Wonderland is out of sight!
Haboglabotribin'!

Now the fun has just begun,
The time has come where we must run.
This energy I have inside,
Controlling feelings I can't hide.
With that I could make a loan,
Can I use the telephone?
I'd like to have one of my own!
Haboglabotribin'!

Whoo! A-take a ride, take a ride!
