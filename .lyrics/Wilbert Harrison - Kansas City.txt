Kansas City here I come
I'm going to Kansas City

They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one

Gonna be standing on the corner
Twelfth Street and Vine
Gonna be standing on the corner
Twelfth Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby
And a bottle of Kansas City wine

Well I might take a train

Going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one

Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one
They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one
