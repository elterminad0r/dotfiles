Jesus born a man
Jesus crucified by man
I'm thinking that Jesus
Wanted man to be free
Jesus got out of hand

Jesus was living the life
Loving the life he lived and had a right to
Jesus just living the life
Loving the life he lived and had a right to

A tree planted by the river water
Homosapien pollutes the air
No more tree the highways are coming
Homosapien progressing

The tree was just living the life
Loving the life it lived and had a right to
The tree was just living the life
Loving the life it lived and had a right to
