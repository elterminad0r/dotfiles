Sometimes the world has a load of questions
Seems like the world knows nothing at all
The world is near but it's out of reach
Some people touch it, but they can't hold on

She is moving to describe the world
(Night must fall, darker, darker)
(She has got to move the world, to move the world, to move the world)
She has messages for everyone
(Night must fall, darker, darker)
(She has got to move the world, to move the world, to move the world)
She is moving by remote control
(Night must fall, darker, darker)
(She has got to move the world, to move the world, to move the world)
Hands that move her are invisible
(Night must fall, darker, darker)
(She has got to move the world, to move the world, to move the world)

The world has a way of looking at people
Sometimes we feel that the world is wrong
She loves the world, and all the people in it
She shakes 'em up when she start to walk

She is only partly human being
(Wanna define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so)
She defines the possibilities
(Wanna define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so)
Holding on for an eternity
(Wanna define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so)
Gone and ending without finishing
(Wanna define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so)

The world moves on a woman's hips
The world moves and it swivels and bops
The world moves on a woman's hips
The world moves and it bounces and hops

A world of light, she gonna op'n our eyes up
A world of light, she gonna op'n our eyes up
She gonna hold me, move me, hold me, move me
Hold, move, hold, hold me, move me
World of light, she gonna op'n our eyes up
