There must be a word that says how much I love you
One fulfilling word that shows how much I care

Wonderful, to be the word
Yes wonderful, I found the word
Oh it's wonderful to be loved by you
It's wonderful to be needed by you

So much pride is what I felt inside
When from the hopeful ? you reach for me
Then I saw my life change when you became
The girl that walks with me, the one that talks to me
And I, I walk with my head held high
People ? me as they pass them by
I got an angel walking by my side

And it's wonderful to be loved by you
It's wonderful to be needed by you

Wonderful, I've got this feeling
So wonderful, there's no concealing
That it's wonderful to be loved by you
It's wonderful to be needed by you

Empty, is how life was for me
Until you took your love and filled it up
And then so suddenly my heart came alive
From the tenderness that you put inside
How you gave me love
And I accept the greatest joy a man can possess
Thank you for giving me, all this happiness

'Cause it's wonderful to be loved by you
So wonderful baby, to be needed by you

Wonderful, I call this feeling
So wonderful, there's no concealing
That it's wonderful to be loved by you
It's wonderful to be needed by you

I'm a happy man baby, 'cause I'm loved by you
Makes me feel so good to be needed by you

It's wonderful to be loved by you
