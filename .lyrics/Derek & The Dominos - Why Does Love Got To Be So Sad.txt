Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Gotta find me a way
Get me back to yesterday
How can I ever hope to forget you?
Won't you show me a place
Where I could hide my lonely face
I know you're gonna break my heart if I let you

Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?

Like a moth to the flame
Like a song without a name
I've never been the same since I met you (woah)
Like a bird on the wing
Got a brand new song to sing
I can't keep from singing about you

Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?

I'm beginning to see
What a fool you've made of me
I might have to break the law when I find you (yes I will now)
Stop running away
I got a better game to play
You know I can't go on living without you, no

Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so, ooh

Woah
Why does love got to be so
Why does love got to be so
