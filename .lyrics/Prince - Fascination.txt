Fascination
I want U
Fascination
I want U, I do
Fascination chamber lands on the round that kills
The art you hoped 2 mirror like
Leaves blood upon the sill
The dream you keep dreaming, is better than the life you lead
The papers run out a day and 13 hours, B4 the weed, it's so high

Fascination
Still I want U
Fascination
Still I want U, I do

The head you thought was rolling, is now reason to be bored
The rapper that gave that head will thank his manager b4 the lord
And the headache that you moan about feels much better than the treatment would
The pills gonna leave a side effect
That'll take another pill 2 correct
And the whole thing is leaving you feeling less than good
And you still high

...Nation
Fascination
Fascination
Fascination

Do you mind if I just watch you shake it
Shake it {4x}

...Nation
I want U
Fascination
I want U, I do

The most vital thing you thought
Is the epitome of doom
U can wake-up in cold sweat
Cause 1 of them is in U're room
Singin' on the tele
Making more bucks than sense
So called king gives birth 2 so called ... prince

A breakup's bitter taste
Still here when the love is gone
And the breaks you wish 4
Finally comes among in song
Working it out
Work, work, work, working it out
Fascination
