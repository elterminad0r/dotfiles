Ooh-wee!
Fellas would you look at that thing
Have you ever...?

You just got back from Paris
You probably went to buy some clothes
You're on your way to Nell's in New York
Gonna meet who? Heaven knows

But it ain't about where you're comin'
It ain't about where you go
It ain't about who you've been with
'Cause it ain't about who you know

It's about that walk - can we talk about it?
It's about that walk - I wanna shout about it

Ooh-wee!

Your ass like a fine cut diamond
Mounted on two legs of stone
The prison I could do some time in
If I ever got that ass alone

But for now I'll just keep my shirt on
'Cause I ain't about losin' cool
('Cause it) ain't about losin' sleep, for that matter
Baby, that nothin' that I do

It's about that walk - I wanna talk about it
It's about that walk - I wanna shout about it

Oh-wee
Oh yeah baby
(Anything else let me do that work, shake it) (Ooh)

Fellas have you ever...?

It ain't about where you're comin'
It ain't about where you go
It ain't about who you've been with
Because it isn't about who you know

It's about that walk, yeah - I wanna talk about it
Baby, baby, baby about the walk - ooh shout about it, shout about it

Ooh-wee!
Oh Lord, Lord
Girl you know you got the walk
Girl you know I got the talk
Run

Lord I mercy...

Eyh!
Keep playing
Ugh!
Vegas on a C
Ooh- (wha-wha...)
Remember 'bout that ending?
On the one
Ugh!
