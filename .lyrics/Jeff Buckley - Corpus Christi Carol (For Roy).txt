He bare her up, he bare her down
He bare her into an orchard ground

Lu li lu lay lu li lu lay
The falcon hath borne my mate away

And in this orchard there was a hall
That was hanged with purple and gold
And in that hall there was a bed
And it was hanged with gold so red

Lu li lu lay lu li lu lay
The falcon hath borne my mate away

And on this bed there lieth a knight
His wound is bleeding day and night
By his bedside kneeleth a maid
And she weepeth both night and day

Lu li lu lay lu li lu lay
The falcon hath borne my mate away

By his bedside standeth a stone
Corpus Christi written thereon
