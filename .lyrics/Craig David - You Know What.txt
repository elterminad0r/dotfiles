Yeah I know that
I said I'm feeling it
I'm feeling it I'm feeling it yeah
I know that you like the way that I put it down on you
You know what yeah

We were meant to be
Together for eternity
But now you're gone it's pain to see
I was living just a fantasy
So many things I'd like to do if ever I found a love that's true
Finding it hard to push on through
Since I've been away from you

When I first met you waiting
Standing up by the bus stop
I knew you were something special
Weak in my knees
I wanted to drop yeah e yeah
So we checked each other
What we had going on was so hot yeah
I never thought you'd leave me no
But you know what

We were meant to be
Together for eternity
But now you're gone it's pain to see
I was living just a fantasy
So many things I'd like to do if ever I found a love that's true
Finding it hard to push on through
Since I've been away from you

Now I can't seem to get over you
Appearing in everything that I do
It was only last week
Friday when I saw you out with your girlfriends walking
Round my way (wanted to stop) yeah e yeah
I feel when all's said and done
From this love I've had I've learnt a lot yeah
I never thought you'd leave me no
But you know what

We were meant to be
Together for eternity
But now you're gone it's pain to see
I was living just a fantasy
So many things I'd like to do if ever I found a love that's true
Finding it hard to push on through
Since I've been away from you

The flow that we had was so hot
Girl you took me higher to the top
We kept it rolling wouldn't stop
Said you'd never leave me
But you know what

We were meant to be
Together for eternity
But now you're gone it's pain to see
I was living just a fantasy
So many things I'd like to do if ever I found a love that's true
Finding it hard to push on through
Since I've been away from you

You don't know what I've been going through
But I know that you don't know what
I said I'm feeling it I'm feeling it I'm feeling it yeah (repeat 2x)
