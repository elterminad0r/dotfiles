Don't need another resolution
To feel as though I'm going somewhere, somewhere.

Velifnei konech
Techinateinu hapili.
Uvea'd amech,
Uvea'd amech...

You said you needed me,
Or at least that's what I thought.
At times the memories
Seem to be knocking at my door.
I've seen the film a million times,
Feels like I wrote the storyline.
I refuse to replay
The mistakes that we made yesterday.

Velifnei konech
Techinateinu hapili.
Uvea'd amech,
Uvea'd amech...

I like to think I'm stronger now,
Victim of common sense.
The truth is that I know I still
Confuse the past with the present tense.
Condensing what we had
To a single frame.
That sticks in my mind,
As I try to move on
The same image comes back every time.

Velifnei konech (They were yesterday's mistakes)
Techinateinu hapili (And they were yesterday's mistakes)
Uvea'd amech (Yesterday's mistakes)
Uvea'd amech... (Somewhere)

Forgive my selfishness,
I'd be grateful if you can
Forget my ingratitude,
You think I'm twice the girl I am.
They say we should forgive,
But not forget,
What has gone before
I refuse to replay
The mistakes that we made yesterday.

Velifnei konech (And they were yesterday's mistakes)
Techinateinu hapili (Yesterday's mistakes)
Uvea'd amech (They were yesterday's mistakes)
Uvea'd amech...

I refuse to replay the mistakes that we made yesterday
