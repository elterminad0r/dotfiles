The kisses of the sun
Were sweet, I didn't blink
I let it in my eyes
Like an exotic dream

The radio playing songs
That I have never heard
I don't know what to say
Oh, not another word

Just lalalalala
It goes around the world
Just lalalalala
It's all around the world

Just lalalalala
And everybody's singing
Lalalalala
And now the bells are ringing

Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala

Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala

Inside an empty room
My inspiration flows
Now wait to hear the tune
Around my head it goes

The magic melody
You want to sing with me
Just lalalalala
The music is the key

And now the night is gone
Still it goes on and on
So deep inside of me
I long to set it free

I don't know what to do
Just can't explain to you
I don't know what to say
Oh, not another word

Just lalalalala
It goes around the world
Just lalalalala
It's all around the world

Just lalalalala
And everybody's singing
Lalalalala
And now the bells are ringing

Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala

Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala

The kisses of the sun
Around, around...
Around the world

Lalalalala
It goes around the world
Just lalalalala
It's all around the world

Just lalalalala
And everybody's singing
Lalalalala
And now the bells are ringing

Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala

Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala

Lalalalala (Round and round and round and round)
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala

Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalalalala
