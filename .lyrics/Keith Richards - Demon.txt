I'm just letting you in, maybe you know
Let me tell you something
It's so painful to say
Which way to go, I don't know.

There's a demon in me, demon in me
Demon in me, yeah I can't live without it.

Every river must flow, shine the light
And I want you to stay but I'm forcing you out
Ooh baby baby, I've to express it (it's such a mess).

Demon in me, demon in me
It's a demon in me, demon in me, yeah yeah.

Between you and me
There's a demon in me
It's a demon in me

Oh I'm warning you up 'cause you slide on my mind
Hammers on my heart, yeah yeah
Which way to go, I don't know.

It's livin' in me, the demon in me
(Demon in me, demon in me ...)
