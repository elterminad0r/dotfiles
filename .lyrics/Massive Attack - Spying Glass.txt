Spy at thy neighbor, spy at thy neighbor
Spy at thy neighbor

You live in the city, you stay by yourself
You a-find all weakness still some people, they brand you ya
And just because you are rasta
You move to the country, you live in the hills
You a-find all company when you check it them a-use spying glass
They want to know all your business

Spy at thy neighbor, spy at thy neighbor

You live in the city, you mind your own business
What you see you don't see but some people, they always see
They never mind their own business
You move to the country, you live in the hills
You think you're far from the weak when you check it them use spying glass
They want to know rasta business
