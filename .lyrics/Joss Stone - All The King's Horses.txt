All the king's horses and all the king's
Men they couldn't put our two hearts together again.
All the king's horses and all the king's
Men they couldn't put our two hearts together again.

We sat on a wall of happiness we sat on a wall of love
We sat on a wall of security so high above. With his arms
Wrapped all around me, it was like a fairy tale. Two people
So in love to the oh could this fact have an effect. The walls
Started shaking her love crying out happiness is given away,
Security is falling down. He fell then I fell and all there is left to tell.

Is all the king's horses and all the king's
Men they couldn't put our two hearts together again.
All the king's horses and all the king's men they couldn't
Put our two hearts together again.

The walls started shaking (yes it did) her love crying out,
Happiness is given away security is tumbling down. He fell
And I fell and all there is left to tell. Is all the king's horses
And all the king's men they couldn't put our two hearts oh
Together again. All the king's horses and all of his men they
Couldn't put our two hearts together again. They couldn't do it baby.
They couldn't put our two hearts together again.
