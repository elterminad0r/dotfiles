Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know were I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone

The South of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Deep sea diving round the clock, bikini bottoms, Lager tops
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know were I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone

We got too little fun
Too little that
We got two in the front
Two in the back

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know were I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
