After all is said and done
How can we carry on?
And after what you've done to me
How did you think that I would be?
You had your chance
When I took you back
Now we're here again
And your hurting me

What would you do?
What would you say?
If you found me gone
If I walked away
What would you learn?
Would your heart be burned?
What would you do babe?
What would you say?
If I walked away

All the promises you made
They never saw the light of day
Many times you you said you'd changed
I was a fool to wait
You had your chance
When I took you back
Now we're here again and you're hurting me

Now that you've been pushing me I'm close to the edge
I'm losing all my patience
I have nothing left
We've been here before
I can't take it no more
I've tried

(What would you do?)
If I walked away
(What would you say?)
If I walked away
(What would you do?)
Tell me would you feel the pain? (feel the pain?)
If I walked away
