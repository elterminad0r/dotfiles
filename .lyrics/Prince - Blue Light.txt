Oh well, here we are again
Lookin' 4 something 2 get us in the mood
I tell each and every one of my friends
That the love we make is really pretty rude
But they don't believe me 'cause it's written all over my face
Like Evian and the deep blue sea
U and me got different taste
U like it in the dark but I like a...

Blue light
Can you turn on a blue light?
Then cuddle up 2 me so tight
Just you and me all night, all right
Blue light
Can you turn on a blue light?
Then everything will be all right
Oh, blue light

U say you wish I was shy
I always take a simple thing and push it way 2 far
But baby, that's the problem with you and I
U say not in public but I say in the car, mm
Say, we need 2 get wild again like it was when we first met
Close your eyes and count 2 10 and when you open 'em
I'll be standing naked with nothing but a smile on

(Well)
I'll be 117
U'll be still sayin' - "Baby, not 2night"
Well, it's easy 2 see us on the cover of a magazine, huh
"Double heart attack, couple both died in a fight"
Well baby, I don't wanna cross that road 'cause I love U 2 much
I'd do anything just 2 heat up your cold touch
Anything I would do, but up until you tell me 2

Hey
Blue light
Can you turn on a blue light?
(Cuddle up 2 me so tight)
Cuddle up next 2 me, baby
U and me all night, all right
Blue light (Light)
Can you turn on a blue light?
And everything will be all right
Oh, blue light {x3}
Blue light {repeat 2 fade}
