Jesus, I am overjoyed to meet you face to face
You've been getting quite a name all around the place
Healing cripples, raising from the dead
And now I understand you're God
At least that's what you've said

So you are the Christ
You're the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me that you're divine
Change my water into wine
That's all you need do
And I'll know it's all true
Come on, King of the Jews

Jesus, you just won't believe
The hit you've made 'round here
You are all we talk about
The wonder of the year
Oh, what a pity
If it's all a lie
Still, I'm sure that you can rock the cynics if you try

So you are the Christ
You're the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me that you're no fool
Walk across my swimming pool
If you do that for me
Then I'll let you go free
Come on, King of the Jews

I only ask things I'd ask
Any superstar
What is it that you have got
That puts you where you are?
Mmm mmm, I am waiting
Yes, I'm a captive fan
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man

So if you are the Christ
Yes, the great Jesus Christ
Feed my household with this bread
You can do it on your head
Or has something gone wrong
Why do you take so long
Come on, King of the Jews

Hey, aren't you scared of me Christ
Mister wonderful Christ
You're a joke, you're not the Lord
You're nothing but a fraud

Take him away, he's got nothing to say
Get out, you King of the
Get out
Get out, you King of the Jews
Get out, you King of the Jews!
Get out of my life!
