Oh please, don't you rock my boat
'Cause I don't want my boat to be rockin'
Oh please, don't you rock my boat, no no
'Cause I don't want my boat to be rockin'

I'm telling you that, oh, oh-wa-whoa-wa-whoa
I like it, like it like this, so keep it steady like this
And you should know, you should know by now
I like it, I like it like this, I like it like this, ooh yeah

Satisfy my soul, oh yeah, you satisfy my soul
Every little action, there's a reaction
Oh, can't you see what you've done for me? oh yeah
I'm happy inside all, all of the time, oh

When we bend a new corner
I feel like a sweepstake winner
When I meet you around the corner
You make me feel like a sweepstakes winner, watch out

Can't you see, you must believe me
Oh, darling, darling, I'm callin', callin'
Can't you see, why won't you believe me?
Oh, darlin' darlin', I'm callin', callin'

When I meet you around the corner
Oh I said, baby, never let me be a loner
And then you hold me tight, you make me feel all right
Yes, when you hold me tight, you make me feel all right, whoa honey

Satisfy my soul
Satisfy my soul
Satisfy my soul
Satisfy my soul
That's all I want you to do
That's all I'll take from you
