I - Who took the money?
Who took the money away?
And I - It's always show time
Here at the edge of the stage
And O U T but no hard feelings
What do you know, take you away
We're being taken for a ride again

I got a girlfriend that's better than that
She has the smoke in her eyes
She's moving up, going right through my heart
She's gonna give me surprise
Better than this, know that it's right
I think you can if you like
I got a girlfriend with bows in her hair
And nothing is better than that, is it?

Down, down in the basement we hear the sound of machines
And I'm, I'm driving in circles, come to my senses sometimes
Why, why, why, why start it over?
Nothing was lost, everything's free
I don't care how impossible it seems

Somebody calls you but you cannot hear
Get closer to be far away
Only one look and that's all that it takes
Maybe that's all that we need

All that it takes, all that it takes
All that it takes, all that it takes
I got a girlfriend that's better than that
She goes wherever she likes, there she goes

I got a girlfriend that's better than that
Now everyone's gettin' involved
As we get older and stop making sense
You won't find her waitin' long
Stop making sense, stop making sense
Stop making sense, making sense (a-ha-ha-ha)
I got a girlfriend that's better than that
And nothing is better than this, huh, is it?
