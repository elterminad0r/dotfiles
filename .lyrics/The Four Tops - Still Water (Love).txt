(Walk with me
Take my hand)

Ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh
(Still water)
Still water

Ah, ah, ah

Never you mind if I
Don't tell strangers passing by
If I don't brag
If I don't brag or boast
Click my glass and say a toast
About my love for you
How it runs so deep and true
And yet it's so
'Cause don't you know, oh
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Ooh

Walk with me
Take my hand

Still waters

Still water
Walk with me
Take my hand
Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep
