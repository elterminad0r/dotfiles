You're a dirty, dirty man
Hey you, you got a dirty mind
You're a dirty, dirty man
You and that other woman, you're two of a kind

But you forgot one thing baby
When you were doing me wrong... oh
That I'm a good housekeeper, I'm gonna take my broom and sweep
All of the dirt, yes sir, out in the street

You're a dirty, o0oh, you're a dirty man
Ooh in so many, so many dirty ways
You're a dirty, dirty man
And you've been hiding your little dirt, all over this here place
I know you have

Ooh here's my chance baby, to throw some mud in your face
'Cause I'm a good housekeeper, I'm gonna take my broom and sweep
All of the dirt, yes I am, out in the street

Ooh I'm cleanin up my whole house, fast as I can
It's time to make everything, oh, spick and span
You're a dirty man, ooh you're a dirty man
Ooh oh you've done me dirty for so many years, yes you did
You're a dirty, dirty man, yes you are

O0o0o oh and I'm tired of you, and your woman, and you're a dog too
You're a dirty man
You're a dirty man
Now get out of my house, don't you never never never never come back again
Don't you never
You're a dirty, you're a dirty man
I'm long done with your dirty ways
