No time for weepin' baby, no tears need flow
Let no one tell you how you should grow, yeah.

Stretched to the limit honey, locked in the hole
Hung out to dry, still on a roll.

Ready, willing, able and big enough.

Run in the front door, run out the back
Wall in your face and a gun in your back.

No time for weepin' baby, no need for tears
Let no one tell you honey, how you should grow.

Big enough, big enough yeah
Big, big enough, yeah yeah
Big enough.

Ready, willing, able and big enough
Ready, willing, able and big enough.
