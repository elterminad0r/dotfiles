Felonius, my old friend
Step on in and let me shake your hand
So glad that you're here again
For one more time let your madness run with mine
In streets still unseen, we'll find somehow
No time is better than now

Tell me where are you drivin' Midnight Cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same

The world that we used to know
People tell me it don't turn no more
The places we used to go
Familiar faces that ain't smilin' like before
The time of our time has come and gone
I fear we been waitin' too long

Tell me where are you drivin' Midnight Cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same

Tell me where are you drivin' Midnite Cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same

Tell me where are you drivin' Midnite Cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentleman loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same
