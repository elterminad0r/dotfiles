"Sometimes"

Ye yo ye yo ye yo ye yo

Sometimes...
I don't love you anymore
I'm in love with you
I think that I'm going mad
I do
Well

Meanwhile...
You been runnin' through my dome
Won't leave me alone
Ooh chile
Why it got to be this way
Gone on!

Can you tell me where, oh where
Oh where, oh where,
Where did the love go?

Sometimes...
I think that you're draining me
I want you at home
I feel like forgiving you
I don't

Meanwhile...
I cannot blame you, my love
I'm sitting here alone
Ooh chile
This love affair ain't what it was
Gone on
Can you tell me where, oh where
Oh where, where,
Where did the love go?

Ye yo ye yo ye yo ye yo ye yo
