Oh baby it's been so long
I've waited so long
And now that I have you
I want you to come
Come come come into my arms
Oh baby I need you I need you
Come come come into my arms again

Spirits move me every time I'm near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind
Oh sweet Peter, angel of my lifetime
Answer to all, answers I can find

Baby, I love you, come
Come, come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby, I want you now
Now, now and hold on fast
Could this be your magic at last

Oh, hold on to me
Don't let go
Oh, oh, come into my life
Ooh, oh, I need you so, baby
Don't let go
Oh, baby, hold on, hold on
Oh

Baby, take me high up on your hillside
High up where the stallion meets the sun
I could love you, build my world around you
Never leave you till my life is done

Baby, I love you, come
Come, come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby, I want you now
Now, now and hold on fast
Could this be your magic at last

Could this be the magic of all of you
Baby, I want you now, now
Now, now and hold on fast
Could this be your magic at last
