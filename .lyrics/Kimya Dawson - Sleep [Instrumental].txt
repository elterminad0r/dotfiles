Sleep little one
Tomorrow's more fun
We'll dance in the rain
And we'll sing in the sun

I think you're the best
But you're being a pest
You know that I love you
But I need my rest

If you love me
You will go pee
Put on your pajamas
And then go to sleep

Please little friend
Get in your bed
And let the adventures
Be dreams in your head

Sleep little one
Tomorrow's more fun
We'll dance in the rain
And we'll sing in the sun
