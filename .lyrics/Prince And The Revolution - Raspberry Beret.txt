One, two, one, two, three, four

Yeah

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

It seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike
And we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something 'bout the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya, if I had the chance to do it all again, ooh
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause, baby, I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then, Lord

(Raspberry beret) Oh
(The kind you find) The kind you find
(In a second hand store) The kind you find, oh no no
(Raspberry beret) Ahha, ah ha
(And if it was warm) Where have all the raspberry women gone
(She wouldn't wear much more)

(Raspberry beret) Yeah, oh
I think I luh, I think I luh, I think I love her

(Raspberry beret) No, no, no
(The kind you find) No, no, no
(In a second hand store)
(Raspberry beret) Tell me where
(And if it was warm) Have all the raspberry women gone
(She wouldn't wear much more)
(Raspberry beret)
