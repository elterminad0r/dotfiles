If you see me walking down the street and I start to cry
Each time we meet
Walk on by... walk on by
Make believe that you don't see the tears just let me grieve
In private 'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
And walk on by...
I just can't get over losing you and so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride is all that I can left so let me hide
The tears and sadness you gave me when you said goodbye
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on...
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride is all that I can left so let me hide
The tears and sadness you gave me when you said goodbye
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Hey baby 'cause I'm walking by
Baby you don't even see the tears I cry
Hey baby 'cause I'm walking by
Baby you don't even see the tears I cry
