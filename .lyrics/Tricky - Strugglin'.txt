Because
In, in, in hell I'll be lost in the layers of weakness
All around the surface
Brainwashed with the cheapest

Strugglin'
Strugglin'
Strugglin'

Brainwashed with the
Hallucinagenics in my system, I cock the trigger
Many switch in
Switch on, switch off

Here I'm lost
(I'm lost)
In the layers of weakness
(Brainwashed)
All around the surface
Brainwashed with the cheapest
Exhausted by the mundane
Simplicity no longer plain

Strugglin'
Strugglin'
Strugglin'
Strugglin' with the insane

I'm strugglin'
I'm strugglin' with the insane
(?)
Hallucinagenics
In my system
(?)
They say I'm insane
I'm strugglin'
Strugglin'

Darkness and warmth
Obvious and mysterious
Magical colors
(Mystical shadows)
Mystical shadows
Thought with no meaning
(They say I'm insane)
Label me insane
But I'm more normal than most
Strugglin' so hard (I just need to remain 'cause I'm strugglin')
To remain
(I know I'm the truth)
'Cause we are the truth
See what we want to see
(Please, please tell me what I, tell me what I want to hear)
Hear what we want to hear
Strugglin' so hard
(I'm strugglin')
I took a ride, yeah
(Roll with the bullets to survive
To survive
To survive
Self preservation)
Roll with the bullets
Just to survive
(Self preservation)
Self preservation
(Keeps the crowd alive)
Keeps the crowd alive

Strugglin'
Strugglin'
They, they say I'm insane
I'm strugglin'
Strugglin'
They say I'm insane

Strugglin'
(I'm more normal than most)
Strugglin'
(I'm just strugglin')
Strugglin'
(Mythical shadows)
Strugglin'
(Mysterious the obvious)
Strugglin'
(They say I'm insane, I'm strugglin')
Strugglin'

Switch in, switch on, switch off
I'm lost in contradiction
Feed me my visuals
A flashback
A flashback from way back
I'm strugglin'
Strugglin'
Do you know what it's like to struggle?
Do you, do you, have you, have you ever had to struggle?
Strugglin'
Strugglin'
Roll with the bullets to survive
Strugglin'
Strugglin'
Strugglin' to remain
They label me insane
But I'm, I'm, I think I'm more normal than most
Strugglin' with the remains
Brainwashed with the cheapest
And if pain makes me stronger
Then how am I stronger?
There's a fate for the late
But the late must wait longer
Strugglin'
Strugglin'
Strugglin'
Roll with the bullets to survive
Self preservation keeps the crowd alive
Strugglin'
In hell, in hell I'll be lost in the layers of weakness
All around the world brainwashed with the cheapest
In hell I'll be lost in the layers of weakness
All around the wolrd brainwashed with the cheapest
Exhausted with the mundane
Simplicity means no longer plain
Strugglin' with the insane
Darkness and warmth
The obvious and mysterious
Magical colors, mythical shadows
Half thought with no meaning
They label me insane
They label me insane
They label me insane
