1969 Studio version

I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too

You held up a stage coach in the rain
And I'm doin' the same
Saw you hangin' from a tree
And I made believe it was me

Oh, I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too

Moon people going to the stratosphere
Soldiers fighting with the Cong
But with you by my side I can do anything
When we swing
We hang past right and wrong

I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
I'll do anything for you
Oh, I'm sticking with you

1970 Studio version

I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too

You held up a stage coach in the rain
(In the rain)
And I'm doin' the same
(The same)
Saw you hangin' from a tree
(From a tree)
And I made believe it was me
(Was me)

Oh, I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too

Moon people going to the stratosphere
Soldiers fighting with the Cong
But with you by my side I can do anything
When we swing
We hang past right and wrong

I'll do anything for you
Baby, anything you want me to
Oh, I'll do anything for you
Oh, I'm sticking with you
