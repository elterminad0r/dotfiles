It could all be so simple
But you'd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars

Tell me who I have to be
To gain some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

Is this just a silly game
That forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can't stay

Tell me who I have to be
To gain some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working (it ain't working)
No, it ain't working
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy (this is crazy)
Oh, this is crazy (this is crazy)

I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else

See, I know what we got to do
You let go and I'll let go too
Cause no one's hurt me more than you
And no one ever will

No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working (it ain't working)
It ain't working (it ain't working)
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy (this is crazy)
Oh, this is crazy (this is crazy)

Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me

Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me

Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me

Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me

Where were you when I needed you

Where were you when I needed you
Where were you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
