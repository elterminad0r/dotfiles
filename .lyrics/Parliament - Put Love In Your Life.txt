Jack's climbing up the ladder
He's going to make it to the top
Although he feels the ladder is shaking
He won't stop he just keeps carrying on
Praying that the ladder won't drop

He's going to be a big man and demand respect from everyone
Wallowing in his victory will be his only way of having fun
Oh he doesn't know he just doesn't know
That one day he might hit the ground
But it's always good always good
To have just a little love around
So put love love in your life
Put love love in your life
Put a little love in your life

Take Sarah She's lucky

Her beauty and wealth are all in vain
Cause her heart is as cold as the mirror she looks in
To practice a smile that is fake
Around her heart that is ice
She better let it melt for heaven's sake

She's going to be a big star
Oh a great big star one day
But she'll run and trample all over the people
The people who get in her way
Oh she doesn't know she just doesn't know
That one day she might hit the ground
So it's always good always good to have
Just a little love around
So put love love love in your life
Put love love love in your life
Put a little love in your life
