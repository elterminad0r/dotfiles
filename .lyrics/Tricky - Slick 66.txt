Tricky:

Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
Lived a little boy he was misled
By another little boy and this is what he said:
"Me and you tonight are gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash."
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another a sister and a brother
Tried to rob a man who was a duty undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said "Look kid, no need for static"
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the little boy was strapped
The kid pulled out the gun, he said "Why'd ya hit me?"
The gun was hang right for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
"I'll do years if I pull this trigger"
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Radios it to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw the sister
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
And due to expectations
He decided he'd head for the roadway stations
She was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed till he was out of breath
He knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
Then he made his move to an abandoned building


He ran up the stairs up to the top floor
And guess who he saw?
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said "Hurry, hurry up and run!"
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
He dipped into a car, a stolen Nova
He raced up the block doing 83
Crashed into a tree near a university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets but still he had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady, got out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said
"Cops back off or the honey here's dead"
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
He let the lady go and he starts to run on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the little boy was surrounded
He dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end my story
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
Just another storye 'bout the wrong path
Straight and narrow while your soul gets cash
Goodnight
