I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about

Every night, every day, just to be there in your arms
Won't you stay
Won't you lay
Stay forever and ever, and ever, and ever

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy it's more than I dare to think about

There's a dark secret in me
Don't leave me locked in your heart
Set me free, feel the need in me, set me free
Stay forever and ever, and ever, and ever

I just can't get you out of my head
I just can't get you out of my head
I just can't get you out of my head
I just can't get you out of my head
