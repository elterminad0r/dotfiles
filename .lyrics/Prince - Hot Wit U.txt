Hot Wit U

I wanna get hot wit U
Get you underneath the cream and oh
Get you doin' things you thought u'd never do
Make you suck your tongue and say... Oh
I wanna get hot wit U
Take you upstairs 2 the 14th room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Oh, I wanna get hot wit U

I wanna get hot wit u, I wanna get hot wit U
I wanna get hot wit u, I wanna get hot wit U

I want 2 get hot with U
I want 2 get you underneath the cream and do, the marshmallow
Oh... I want 2 get hot with U
I wanna get U 2 do something you thought u'd never do
Like dance in front of my headlights
On a hot summer night... nude
I want 2 get hot with U

I wanna get hot wit U
Get you underneath the cream and oh
Get you doin' things you thought u'd never do
Make you suck your tongue and say... Oh
I wanna get hot wit U
Take you upstairs 2 the 14th room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Oh, I wanna get hot wit U

I want 2 get hot with U
I wanna make you climb this chain around my waist so I can prove
That I'm the only one that brings out the freak in U
I want 2 to get hot with U

I wanna get hot wit U, I wanna get hot wit you Huh
I wanna get hot wit U, I wanna get hot wit U

Know the body bangin' got you singing
Annoying shouts from neighbors, telephone ringing
Put me in positions thought I'd never do proper
Created a machine now you know you can't stop her
Tryin' 2 turn me out, it'll never happen, so stop this
I'm supposed to tremble 'cause they call U "The Artist"?
Let's wild out - can you handle rough ridin'?
Treat you like the freak of the week and had you hiding from me
I'd do whatever you like if you can take it
If I can be u're girlfriend you can catch me naked
Can't front sexually I'd like a sample
But I don't think that I'm ready for U 2 make me an example
I mean c'mon why front on?
I'd never place time, queen in u're life, I'm there whenever
The things that you feelin' for me - mutual
That I'm ready to call U "Daddy", even get hot with U

Meet me early morning
(Meet me early morning baby)
In a 4th dimension plane
(4th dimension plane)
Astral travelin' hottie
(Hottie, hottie)
I know you know my game
Underneath the cream I'll meet U
(I'll meet you down there)
And then we'll rearrange
(Turn the child 'round)
Everything you know of love
(Everything)
I'll give U a reason 2 change
(Hot wit U, I wanna get hot wit U - I wanna, wanna boo)

I wanna get hot wit U (I wanna get)

I want 2 get hot with U
I wanna steal a kiss in the middle of an
Overcrowded room yeah, that's what I wanna do
I, I, I, I wanna get with U, hot with U... boo

I wanna get hot wit U
Get you underneath the cream and oh
Get you doin' things you thought u'd never do
Make you suck your tongue and say... Oh
I wanna get hot wit U
Take you upstairs 2 the 14th room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Oh, I wanna get hot wit U

Take a drive 2 the ocean
And drown you in a wave
Of a hundred thousand compliments boo
I want your everyday 2 be cool
And the only way 2 do that is every night
Get hot, Get hot with U... yeah baby

Get you underneath the cream and oh
Get you doin' things you thought u'd never do (never, never)
Make you suck your tongue and say... Oh

Multicolored lights and an ocean view (can't you see it)
