[Intro: Song fades in]
Whoa whoa whoa
Ummmm ummmmm
Whoa whoa whoa
Yeah
Ummmm ummmmm
Whoa whoa whoa

Fantasy is reality in the world today
I'll keep hanging in there that's the only way
Recollections of what Grandaddy used to say
Keeps me hanging in there that's the only way

My mind is mine and mine my mind will always stay
No way of life no man made law is gonna take it away
I see the light and taste the blood of your song
It tells me to carry on and it tells me to come on home

Ummmm ummmmm
Whoa whoa whoa
Recollections of what Grandaddy used to say
Keeps me hanging in there that's the only way

My mind is mine and mine my mind will always stay
No way of life no man made law is gonna take it away
I see the light and taste the blood of your song
It tells me to carry on and it tells me to come on home

Fantasy is reality in the world today
I'll keep hanging in there that's the only way
Recollections of what Grandaddy used to say
Keeps me hanging in there that's the only way

Fantasy is reality in the world today
I'll keep hanging in there that's the only way
Recollections of what Grandaddy used to say
Keeps me hanging in there that's the only way

[Instrument riff]

I see the light and taste the blood of your song
It tells me to carry on and it tells me to come on home

Fantasy is reality in the world today
I'll keep hanging in there that's the only way
Recollections of what Grandaddy used to say
Keeps me hanging in there that's the only way

Ummmm ummmmm
Whoa whoa whoa

Fantasy is reality in the world today
I'll keep hanging in there that's the only way
Recollections of what Grandaddy used to say
Keeps me hanging in there that's the only way

[spoken]
Fantasy is reality in the world today

Whoa whoa whoa

Fantasy is reality in the world today
I'll keep hanging in there that's the only way
Recollections of what Grandaddy used to say
Keeps me hanging in there that's the only way

[Fade out]
Fantasy is reality in the world today
I'll keep hanging in there that's the only way
Recollections of what Grandaddy used to say
