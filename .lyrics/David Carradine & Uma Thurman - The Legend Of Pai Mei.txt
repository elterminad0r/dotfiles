Bill:
Once upon a time...
...In China...
...Some believe around the year...
...One double aught-three, head priest of the White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down a road...
...Contemplating whatever it is that a man of Pai Mei's infinite powers would contemplate - which is another way of saying, "Who knows?" - when a Shaolin monk appeared on the road, traveling in the opposite direction. As the monk and the priest crossed paths...
...Pai Mei...
...In a practically unfathomable display of generosity, gave the monk the slightest of nods. The nod...
...Was not returned. Now, was it the intention of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei? Or did he just fail to see the generous social gesture? The motives of the monk remain unknown. What is known...
...Were the consequences.

Bill:
The next morning, Pai Mei appeared at the Shaolin temple...
...And demanded of the temple's head abbot that he offer Pai Mei his neck to repay the insult. The abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei. Only to find Pai Mei was...
...Inconsolable.

(Bill plays the flute)

Bill:
So began...
...The Massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and all sixty of the monks inside, at the fists of the White Lotus. And...
...So began the legend...
...Of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm-Exploding-Heart-Technique.

The Bride:
And what, pray tell, is the Five-Point-Palm-Exploding-Heart-Technique?
