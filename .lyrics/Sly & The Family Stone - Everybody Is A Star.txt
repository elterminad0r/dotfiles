Everybody is a star
Who could rain and chase the dust away
Everybody wants to shine
Who will come out on a cloudy day?

'Tis the sun that loves you 'round
When the system tries to bring you down
Every had to shine at night
You don't need darkness to do what you think is right

Everybody is a star
I can feel it when you shine on me
I love you for who you are
Not the one you feel you need to be

Ever catch a falling star
Ain't no stopping 'til it's on the ground
Everybody is a star
One big circle goin round and round

Shine, shine, shine, shine
