I think about it baby all the time, all right
It feels so good it must be a crime, all right
I wanna do it, baby, everyday, all right
In a bed, on the stairs, anywhere, all right

(Come on)

I wanna do it, baby, all the time, all right
'Cause when we do it, girl, it's so divine, all right

I could be guilty for my honesty (all right)
But I've got to tell you what you mean to me, (all right) all right
With you, I swear I'm a maniac, all right
You see, it ain't no joke, just a natural fact, all right (all right) Come on

I wanna do it baby all the time, all right
'Cause when we do it, girl, it's so divine, all right

(Doin' it) It
(Doin' it) It
(Doin' it) It
