Maid by the fire
I think I've seen you somewhere.
I remember,
You were with that man they took away.
I recognize your face.

Peter
You've got the wrong man lady.
I don't know him,
And I wasn't where he was tonight
Never near the place.

Soldier
That's strange, for I am sure I saw you were with him.
You were right by his side, and yet you denied.

Peter
I tell you I was never ever with him.

Old man
But I saw you too. It looked just like you.

Peter
I don't know him!

Mary magdalene
Peter, don't you know what you have said?
You've gone and cut him dead.

Peter
I had to do it, don't you see?
Or else they'd go for me.

Mary magdalene
It's what he told us you would do.
I wonder how he knew.
