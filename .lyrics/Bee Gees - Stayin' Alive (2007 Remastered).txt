Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
But now it's all right, that's okay
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive
Oh when you walk

Well now I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancing man, and I just can't lose
You know it's all right, it's okay
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
And I'm stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive
Ahh

Life going nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life going nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive

Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
Now it's all right, it's okay
And you can look the other way
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
And I'm stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive
Hey

Life going nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life going nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Life going nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life going nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Life going nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life going nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Life going nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life going nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
