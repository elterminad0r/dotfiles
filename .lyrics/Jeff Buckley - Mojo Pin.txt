I'm lying in my bed
The blanket is warm
This body will never be
Safe from harm

Still feel your hair
Black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin
To keep me whole

Oh if only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no mojo pin
To keep me satisfied

Don't wanna weep for you
Don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow
Memories fire
The rhythms fall slow
Black beauty I love you so

Oh precious, precious silver and gold
And pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down we two to serve
And pray to love

Born again from the rhythm
Screaming down from heaven
Ageless, ageless
I'm there in your arms

Don't wanna weep for you
I don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow
The memories fire
The rhythms fall slow
Black beauty I love you so

So, so, so

Oh welts of your scorn, my love, gimme more
Send whips of opinion down my back, gimme more
Well it's you I've waited my life to see
It's you I've searched so hard for

Don't wanna weep for you
Don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow
Memories fire
The rhythms fall slow
Black beauty I love you so

So!
Black, black, black beauty!
