A kiss is not a contract
But it's very nice
Mmm. it's very nice
Just because you've been exploring my mouth
Doesn't mean you get to take an expedition further south, no

A kiss is not a contract
But it's very nice
It's very very nice
Just because we've been playing tonsil hockey
Doesn't mean you get to score the goal that's in my jockeys
Just because I'm in a two-man novelty band
Doesn't mean it's all about poon-tang
I can't go around loving everyone
I just wouldn't get anything done
You could take me out to dinner that might be quite nice
You could buy me a burrito and some beans and rice
But that won't get you into pants paradise
They call it a fly because it takes you up to Heaven, Whoa-oh

A kiss is not a contract
But it's very nice
It's very very nice
I'm only one man
Baby, pretty baby
We're only two men, Ladies
Babies, oh pretty babies.
