When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar, I definitely wanted to become a musician. It was almost impossible because it was, the dream was so big that I didn't see any chance, because I was living in a little town. I was studying and when I finally broke away from school and became a musician, I thought, "Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance," because all I really wanted to do is music, and not only play music, but compose music.

At that time, in Germany, in '69-'70, they had already discotheques. So I would take my car, would go to a discotheque, sing maybe thirty minutes. I think I had about seven, eight songs. I would partially sleep in the car because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about almost two years to survive in the beginning.

I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s, the sounds of the '60s, of the '70s, and then have a sound of the future, and then I thought, "Wait a second, I know the synthesizer. Why don't I use the synthesizer, which is the sound of the future?"

And I didn't have any idea what to do, but I knew I needed a click so we put the click on the 24-track which then was synced to the Moog modular. I knew that could be a sound of the future but I didn't realize how much the impact would be.

My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio.

Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct, you can do whatever you want, so nobody told me what to do, and there was no preconception of what to do.
