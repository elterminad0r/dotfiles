(Ferry/Leonard)

Mystery of life
Buried in the sand
Moving finger write
I am longing to understand
Driving away the dark
Uncertainty
A shooting star
Can go so far
It's where I want to be
Open your eyes
Day for night
Look what you done to me
Open your heart
Stay tonight
No woman could mean
So much to me
Mystery of love
Do you see
The light of the day now?
Hidden by a veil
Are the ways
Of a cheating heart
Wish I could change your mind
The restless sea
A shooting star
Can go so far
It's where I want to be
