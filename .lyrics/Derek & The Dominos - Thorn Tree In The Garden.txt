There's a thorn tree in the garden
If you know just what I mean
And I hate to hurt your feelings
But it's not the way it seems
'Cause I miss her

She's the only girl I've cared for
The only one I've known
And no one ever shared more love
Than we've known
And I miss her

But it all seems so strange to see
'Cause she'd never turn her back on me
And leave without a last goodbye
And if she winds up walking the streets
Loving every other man she meets
Who'll be the one to answer why

Lord, I hope it's not me
It's not me

And if I never see her face again
I never hold her hand
And if she's in somebody's arms
I know I'll understand
But I miss that girl
I still miss that girl

Maybe someday soon
Somewhere
