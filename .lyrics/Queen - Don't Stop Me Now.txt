Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real, good time, I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah, I'm floating around in ecstasy
So, don't stop me now, don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time

I'm a shooting star, leaping through the sky like a tiger
Defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car, passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call

Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes, I'm having a good time, I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine, ready to reload like an atom bomb
About to whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me, hey, hey, hey
Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh-ooh-ooh, I like it
Don't stop me, don't stop me, have a good time, good time
Don't stop me, don't stop me, ahh
(Let loose, honey, all right)

Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit, hey
Travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you, yeah, yeah

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time just give me a call

Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes, I'm having a good time, I don't want to stop at all
