So you thought you just might lose your mind 2day
Brother pushin' that game on ya as if you wanna play
Askin' you every other sentence if them titties are real
One tramp even had the nerve 2 touch 'em as if you wanted a feel

Shoo-bed-ooh, shoo-bed-ooh, ooh!
Shoo-bed-ooh, shoo-bed-ooh, ooh!

The money that you make ain't payin' the rent, so you sleep in cars
U wonder aloud if u're happy - u say, yeah, as if you really are
This car you drive with no gas won't take you very far
U look up in the sky and wish upon a star (upon a star)

The answer 2 the question of life is a gray-haired bitch at least
Suckin' on the ebony dancer in between these dirty sheets
Spittin' out the aftertaste of a boy who might not call again
If this is the game you stood in line 4 ¨c how're you gonna win?

(How're you gonna win?)
Shoo-bed-ooh, shoo-bed-ooh, ooh!

So you thought he just might come every time you phone
As if u've never been lonely as if u've never been alone
(As if u've never been alone)
How you ever gonna win if you let 'em all see your hand?
Playin' the queen don't work on your knees as if you understand

The answer 2 the question of life is a gray-haired bitch at least
Suckin' on the ebony dancer in between these dirty sheets
Spittin' out the aftertaste of a boy who might not call again
If this is the game you stood in line 4 ¨c how're you gonna win?
How you gonna win?

So you thought you just might lose your mind 2day
