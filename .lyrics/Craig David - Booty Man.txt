Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh yeah eh yeah babe yeah eh yeah babe,
Hey whoa oh oh, oh oh oh yeah eh yeah babe yeah eh yeah babe

One, two buckle, my shoes three, four step inside the venue and ah,
See in the corner of my eye,
This beautiful girl that's standing by the bar looking fly
She was like a beauty queen,
Out of a magazine looked about nineteen,
Five minutes talking next thing it's her number being written,

If you're looking for a man who can
Go check all the girls messing up with your program
With lyrics that make you say Damn
The Booty Man can
International bomb (Bomb)
The Booty Man's really got it going on

One, two unbuckle my shoe,
Kissing and cuddling at my crib after the venue and ah,
I didn't wanna take it too fast,
So I said slow slow I gotta make some calls so keep it down low,
She was like I can't believe,
You wanna talk instead of making love to me,
Five minutes chilling next thing it's my name she's calling

If you're looking for a man who can
Go check all the girls messing up with your program
With lyrics that make you say Damn
The Booty Man can
International bomb (Bomb)
The Booty Man's really got it going on

On, oh oh oh oh on
The Booty Man Booty Man's really got it going on,
Oh oh oh oh on
The Booty Man Booty Man's really got it going on
Oh oh oh oh on
The Booty Man Booty Man's really got it going on
Oh oh oh oh on the Booty Man Booty man's really got it

If you're looking for a man who can
Go check all the girls messing up with your program
With lyrics that make you say Damn
The Booty Man can
International bomb (Bomb)
The Booty Man's really got it going on

If you're looking for a man who can
Go check all the girls messing up with your program
With lyrics that make you say Damn
The Booty Man can
International bomb (Bomb)
The Booty Man's really got it going on

If you're looking for a man who can
Go check all the girls messing up with your program
(Meesin' up wid yer programme)
With lyrics that make you say Damn
(Hey yeah)
The Booty Man can
(Ooh yes I can)
International bomb (Bomb)
The Booty Man's really got it going on
(Oh on)
