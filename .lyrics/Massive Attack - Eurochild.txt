Sitting in my day care, the art is deco painted
Blessed by the drink
Upon the corner's where we've seen it
Chased by the plane it, haunted by the medium
Too high to flow toward to break the tedium
Glow from my TV set was blue like neon
Activated the remote, I put the BBC on
I've seen this city somewhere, I'm looking out for no one
Pallor in my eye, it get blue like neon
Hell is 'round the corner where I shelter
Isms and schisms, we're living on a skelter
If you believe I'll deceive, then common sense says shall you receive
Let me take you down the corridors of my life
And when you walk, do you walk to your preference
No need to answer 'til I take further evidence
I seem to need a reference to get residence
A reference to your preference to say I'm a good neighbour
I trudge, so judge me for my labour

I walk in a bar and immediately I sense danger
You look at me, girl, as if I was some kind of a, a total stranger
Hysterical, ecstatical, no matter, call me stags
Hard to get a drink or a girl to relax
Upon phono, no go zone I go through
Aching awaits just to relocate you
Kill us with your fist
Now, baby, mix it with me
You see me function better when I get approximately
High by my technical flyby
I function better with the sun in my eyes, so goodbye

Take a second of me, you beckon I'll be
And when you're sad, I'll mourn
And when you tear, I'm torn
Take a second of me, take a second of me
I stand firm for our soil, I lick a rock off foil
So reduce me, seduce me, dress me up in Stussy
Show me and I'll stick 'em
Will you be my victim, take a second of me
Mad over you, mad over me, an analogy
Baby tagging up all of my stationary
Sitting in my daycare, media deco painted
Colliding with the jam until the drink got dated
Window indigo when they go boom
I run inside my room, no sense you can trust me
Climb on my sofa, roll in a daydream
Spliff make daddy go sleep-a-trip dream
