You will but you won't, you do but you don't
The more that you say, you don't do it anyway
You know that you don't.

Ooh you've got it in for me, you always did anyway
It's a sin to me, yeah.

Guilty or not, it's time that I got myself out of here, yeah
Caress me baby, slap me my face
Ooh don't hurt me baby.

You're big but you're bad, like something I had
Sensitive words they get on my nerves, it's driving me mad
You made a mess of my heart.

(Do what you won't, do what you don't)
(Do what you won't, do what you don't).

I need your hands running over me
I like the way that it feels, yeah yeah
Without a sound, hey baby help.

I need your hands running over me
I like the way that it feels
I need your hands running over me
I like the way that it feels.

You will but you won't, hu you do but you don't
Yeah you go yes and it's no
I don't till I know where and which way to go
Put a gun to me and to the way that I feel.

I'm gonna get out of the way
Can't you hear what I, hear what I say yeah
I want to make up your mind
I want to rearrange it babe
You got me mind.
