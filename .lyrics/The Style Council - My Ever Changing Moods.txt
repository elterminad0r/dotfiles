Daylight turns to moonlight
And I'm at my best, yeah
Praising the way it all works
And gazing upon the rest, yeah

The cool before the warmth
The calm after the storm
Oh, the cool before the warmth
The calm after the storm

I wish to stay forever
Letting this be my food
Oh, but I'm caught up in a whirlwind
And my ever changing moods, yeah

Bitter turns to sugar
Some call a passive tune
But the day things turn sweet for me
Won't be too soon, no

The hush before the silence
The winds after the blast
Oh, the hush before the silence
The winds after the blast

I wish we'd move together
This time the bust ensued
Oh, but we're caught up in the wilderness
And an ever changing moods, yeah

Teardrops turn to children
Who've never had the time
To commit the sins they pay for through
Another's evil mind

The love after the hate
The love we leave too late
Oh, the love after the hate
The love we leave too late

I wish we'd wake up one day
And everyone feel moved
Oh, but we're caught up in the dailies
And an ever changing mood, yeah

Evil turns to statues
Masses form a line
But I know which way I'd run to
If the choice was mine

The past is our knowledge
The present our mistake
And the future we always
Leave too late

I wish we'd come to our senses
And see there is no truth
Oh, in those who promote the confusion
For this ever changing moods, yeah
