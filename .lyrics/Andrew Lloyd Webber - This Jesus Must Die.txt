Priest 1
Good Caiaphas the council waits for you
The Pharisees and Priests are here for you

Caiaphas
Ah gentlemen - you know why we are here
We've not much time and quite a problem here

CROWD (outside)
Hosanna! Superstar!...

Annas
Listen to that howling mob of blockheads in the street!
A trick or two with lepers and the whole town's on its feet

ALL
He is dangerous

CROWD (outside)
Jesus Christ Superstar - tell us that you're who they say you are

ALL
He is dangerous

Priest 1
That man is in town right now to whip up some support

Priest 2
A rabble rousing mission that I think we must abort

ALL
He is dangerous!

CROWD (outside)
Jesus Christ Superstar...

ALL
He is dangerous!

Priest 2
Look Caiaphas - they're right outside our yard

Priest 1
Quick Caiaphas - go call the Roman guard

Caiaphas
No wait - we need a more permanent solution to our problem...

Annas
What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth
Miracle wonderman - hero of fools?

Priest 2
No riots, no army, no fighting, no slogans

Caiaphas
One thing I'll say for him - Jesus is cool

Annas
We dare not leave him to his own devices
His half - witted fans will get out of control

Priest 1
How can we stop him?

Priest 2
His glamour increases

Priest 1
By leaps every minute

Priest 2
He's top of the poll

Caiaphas
I see bad things arising - the crowd crown him king
Which the Romans would ban
I see blood and destruction, our elimination because of one man
Blood and destruction because of one man

ALL
Because, because, because of one man

Caiaphas
Our elimination because of one man

ALL
Because, because, because of one, 'cause of one, 'cause of one man

Priest 1
What then to do about this Jesusmania?

Annas
How do we deal with the carpenter king?

Priest 1
Where do we start with a man who is bigger

Priest 2
Than John was when John did his Baptism thing?

Caiaphas
Fools! You have no perception!
The stakes we are gambling are frighteningly high!
We must crush him completely!
So like John before him, this Jesus must die
For the sake of the nation this Jesus must die

ALL
Must die, must die, this Jesus must die

Caiaphas
So like John before him, this Jesus must die

ALL
Must die, must die, this Jesus must,
Jesus must, Jesus must die!
