I hadn't anyone till you, I was a lonely one till you
I used to lie awake and wonder, if there could be
A someone in this wide world, just made for me
And now I see I had to save my love for you

I never gave my love till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you

And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you
