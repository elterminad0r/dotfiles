Now listen to me baby, I keep it on so low
And I whisper to you sister, now we're all alone
Take no notice of me baby like a dream
Gonna keep it quiet so I can hear you scream.

Words of wonder are the words I wanna hear
Words of wonder are the words I wanna hear.

I'm sticking to you baby until I arrive
And I'm half dead, a quarter alive
A little bit is missing, wonder where it's gone
Pay me no attention, I babble on and on.

Words, those words of wonder are the words I wanna hear
Yeah those words, the words of wonder, they are the words I wanna hear.

Dripping from your lips, yeah that's the way it goes
That's the way it comes, ya' know what I mean
Now that your talkin' to me baby
Still you say that I'm obscene.

Words, words of wonder, they are the words I wanna hear
Words, those words of wonder are the words I wanna hear.

Let me roll it over baby
Now I got to jam it up, make you weep and moan
Go around the back baby and make yourself known.

The words, these are words of wonder
These are the words you better learn
These are words, these words of wonder
These are words you ought to know.

You been talkin' to me sweetie.

You know I babble on and on
Ooh, I run away my tongue
(Giving thanks and praises)
(Low friends in high places)
I'm gonna whisper these words of wonder ...
