Oh-ooh

Wherever you go, whatever you do
Oh please, remember that I'll always be there 4 U
U don't have 2 call, U don't have 2 say
Just think about me and I'll be on my way
I don't have 2 worry, I'm sure U'll be fine
'Cause if you stay happy, then what's your's is mine
Wherever you go, whatever you do
Remember that I'll always be there 4 U
(Oh Baby)

Wherever U R, think of your dreams
Oh please, remember life ain't always what it seems
4 each rainy day (rainy day)
That comes your way
The sun will come shining and U'll be okay
Keep on smiling - every girl and boy
Remember when you were children you had toys
Wherever U R, think of your dreams
Remember that dreams become the life you lead

Whatever you play, it's okay 2 lose
Ooh sometimes (sometimes...)
As long as you learn from every game you choose
If one thing is sure, U'll always endure
If you try your best at everything you do
Say what you mean and mean what you say
The price 4 a broken heart - it's 2 much 2 pay
And nothing is worth it, if you don't have 2 try
The higher the stakes - the higher the sky

Wherever you go, whatever you do
Please remember
Remember that I'll always be there 4 U
