I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be
A woman
I just wanna be a woman

From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over and give us some room
Yeah

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be
A woman
I just wanna be a woman

So don't you stop bein' a man
Just take a little look
From our side when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be
A woman
I just wanna be a woman
It's all I wanna be is a woman

For this is the beginning of forever and ever
It's time to move over
(It's all I wanna be)

I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just
Give me a reason to love you
