I'm waitin' baby, between the lines
Believin' is deceivin'
Watch you move, brand new walk
Body talks in a word
Body talks, baby, yeah
You make me shiver, just a quiver
The way you shake, it's a good sign
My heart aches, yeah.

(Body talks) shimmy shimmy shake
It's not so hard baby, hard baby
It's the way you move
(Body talks) read your hips
You make me bite my lip
(Body talks) waitin' on the flinch
(So alive).

It's just a look and I read it like a book
It's nothing you said, it's something I read
It's the way you move
It's the way you move.
