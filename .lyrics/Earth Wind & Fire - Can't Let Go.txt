Love that is born in truth, all
The doubt removed--lover's eyes
Are blessed only sees the best--

I can't let go, of a love that
Grows, you're my woman. Baby love
You know I love you, so

Empty hearts are free, bring,
Your love to me--soul chase the moon
Shadows, hug the room--turn off the
Light and sneak in bed at night--
Darkness shut its eyes, Baby, I
Open mine to you

I can't let go, of a love that
Grows, you're my woman, baby love
You know I love you so
