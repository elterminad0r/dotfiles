Time has been lost for trying
We have been left outside
Looking at passions dying
Emotions grow strong on time

But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on

They might have said we're lying
No matter how hard we tried
Those who have watched us crying
Can figure how love has died

But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on

Time has been lost for trying
We have been left outside
Looking at passions dying
Emotions grow strong on time

But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright, we can still go on
But it's alright
