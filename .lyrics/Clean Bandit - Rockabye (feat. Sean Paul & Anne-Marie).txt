Call it love and devotion
Call it the mom's adoration
Foundation
A special bond of creation, hah
For all the single mums out there going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean-da-Paul, Anne-Marie

She works the night, by the water
She's gonna stress, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (daily struggle)
She tells him "uh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"
She tells him "your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do"

So, Rockabye baby, Rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, Rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye, no
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
Rockabye, oh oh yeah
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye

Single mama you doing out there
Facing the hard life, without no fear
Just so you know that you really care
Cause any obstacle come you're well prepared
And no mama, you never set tear
Cause you have to set things year and to year
And you give the youth love beyond compare
You find his school fee and the bus fare
Mmm Marie, the paps' disappear
In the round back can't find him nowhere
Steadily you work flow, everything you know
You know say you nuh stop the time fi a jear

Now she gotta a six year old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks her in the eyes
He don't know he's safe

When she says "uh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"

So, Rockabye baby, Rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, Rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Bidda-bang-bang-bang, alright then
Rockabye, no
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
Rockabye, oh oh yeah
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
