(Here they come again, here they come again, hope they're gonna find me
I can't find my way, changing every day, hope you're gonna find me)
Oh hope they're gonna find me, oh hope they're gonna find me)

(Here I am looking for love and affection
I keep on looking for love and affection
For love and affection
Oh I'm so lonely for love
Oh so lonely for love)

Why is that when I wake up every day
Your words run into everything that I might say?
Every thought, every smile finds it way back to you
Every step that I take, anything that I do
Oh I haven't forgotten you

When the telephone rings my hands start to shake
Seems that I give so much more than I take
Every thought, every smile finds it way back to you
Every step that I take, anything that I do
Oh I haven't forgotten you

Pretty tunes don't mean a lot when I'm singing just for you
Don't have to say a lot but it's all that I can do
And you know it's for you

But whatever you do doesn't change the way I feel
You're all that is love, you're everything real
Every thought, every smile finds it way back to you
Every step that I take, anything that I do
Oh I haven't forgotten you

Why is that when I wake up every day
Your words run into everything that I might say?
Every thought, every smile finds it way back to you
Every step that I take, anything that I do
Oh I haven't forgotten you

Here I am looking for love and affection
I keep on looking for love and affection
For love and affection
Oh I'm so lonely for love
Oh so lonely for love
