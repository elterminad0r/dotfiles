Baby baby, don't look so sad
There's gonna be a better tomorrow
Omoi tobira no mukō wa itsu demo aozora sa

Kinō to onaji ichinichi ga kurete
Kanojo wa hukai tameiki to tomoni nemuru
Hatasenakatta yakusoku mata hitotsu hueta dake
Soredemo ashita o yumemiru

Baby baby, close your eyes
Go back into your endless dream
Mezameru koro wa tokkuni egao ga modotteru

Iikoto dake o shinjiteru uchi ni
Subete o yuruseru jibun ni aeru itsuka
Anna ni aishita hito mo aishitekureta hito mo
Hurimukeba tada no maboroshi

Baby baby, don't think you're lonely
Don't give up loving somebody new
Kurikaesareru wakere ni okubyō ni naranaide

Ah, samishii nante
Ah, kanjiru hima mo nai kurai

Hatasenakatta yakusoku mata hitotsu hueta dake
Soredemo ashita o yumemiru

Baby baby, don't look so sad
There's gonna be a better tomorrow
Omoi tobira no mukō wa itsu demo aozora sa

Baby baby, close your eyes
Go back into your endless dream
Hateshinai yume no tsuzuki misasete ageru kara

Just believe someday you'll find your hard time's gone
Try not to look back on your yesterday
So keep on dreaming of tomorrow
Don't you think you're lonely
Don't give up on loving
Somebody's waiting just for you

Just believe someday you'll find your hard time's gone
Try not to look back on your yesterday
So keep on dreaming of tomorrow
Don't you look so sad, girl
There will be a fine thing
Everything will be all right

Just believe someday you'll find your hard time's gone
Try not to look back on your yesterday
So keep on dreaming of tomorrow
Baby, close your brown eyes
Go back to your dreaming
You can see the blue sky spread

English

Baby baby, don't look so sad
There's gonna be a better tomorrow

Behind the heavy door is always a blue sky
Another day just like yesterday has closed
Girl, you fall asleep with a deep sigh

Having ended up with another unfulfilled promise

Yet you're gonna dream for tomorrow

Baby baby, close your eyes
Go back into your endless dream

A smile will be back on your face long before you wake up

As you believe only in good things

Someday you'll find yourself being able to forgive anything

Those you once loved that much and those who once loved you that much

They're all mere illusions if you look back now

Baby baby, don't think you're lonely
Don't give up loving somebody new

Don't be discouraged by repeated goodbyes

Ah, never even feel lonely

Ah, by getting busy loving someone

Having ended up with another unfulfilled promise

Yet you're gonna dream for tomorrow

Baby baby, don't look so sad
There's gonna be a better tomorrow

Behind the heavy door is always a blue sky

Baby baby, close your eyes
Go back into your endless dream

I'll let you have the rest of the endless dream

Just believe someday you'll find your hard time's gone
Try not to look back on your yesterday
So keep on dreaming of tomorrow
Don't you think you're lonely
Don't give up on loving
Somebody's waiting just for you

Just believe someday you'll find your hard time's gone
Try not to look back on your yesterday
So keep on dreaming of tomorrow
Don't you look so sad, girl
There will be a fine thing
Everything will be all right

Just believe someday you'll find your hard time's gone
Try not to look back on your yesterday
So keep on dreaming of tomorrow
Baby, close your brown eyes
Go back to your dreaming
You can see the blue sky spread
