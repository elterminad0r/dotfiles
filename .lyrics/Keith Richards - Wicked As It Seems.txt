It's just as wicked as it seems
Just run out of dreams
Better of two evils, babe
It's one time too much
Baby, how can I say what's in my heart, what's in my heart?
Come a long way, well since you beat it up (beat it up, beat it up).

As wicked as it seems yeah
(Why don't you get ?) get all over me?
(Why don't you get ?) get all over me yeah?
Just a two way street but now it goes one way
And now for me there's no way out (no way out) one time
(Why don't you get ?) get all over me?

As wicked as it seems yeah
It's playtime but it's far too late
It's gonna too hard on (hard on, hard on it)
What you gonna give
(It's not enough) it's not enough for me
So I soften the blow, so the bruises don't show
I've got the expertise.

No broken necks, mm no broken hearts
Well we used your deck
All I did was play the cards (now the check)
Now I find (it's not enough) it's not enough for me
Now you want to give (is not enough) is not enough for me yeah.

As wicked as it seems yeah
(Why don't you get ?) get all over me?
Yeah one time
(Why don't you get ?) get all over me ? (Why don't you get ?)
It's easy getting in
(Why don't you get ?) get all over me?
But it's a hard way out babe
(Why don't you get ?) get all over me ? (Why don't you get ?)
