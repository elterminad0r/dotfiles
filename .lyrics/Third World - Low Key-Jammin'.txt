We roots roots roots
But we intellect say wa? (say what?)
Time crucial but we cool wa wa wa wa
Low keyed but jamming high level high level
We ain't got to be no rude boys
We irie irie irie
We irie irie irie
Hypocrite I know you really don't like JAH music
Ruff pon you

We jamming
We keep on jamming
Low key, laid back
But we jamming and I no pop no style
We go keep on jamming
Low key, laid back
But we jamming (jamming straight to you head)
We go keep a jammin'
Low key laid back
But we jammin' - well

We none political
But we serious
Rasta musical come and jam with us
Play it all night long and
It's the same jamrock song we sing
We don't really have to be no screwface

Because we irie, irie, irie I know we truly
Irie, irie, irie

All around the world we're gonna sing
JAH music (sweet me to my bone)
We jammin' (sweet me to my bone)
We on keep on jammin'
Low key, laid back
But we jammin' (and I no pop no style)
We go keep on jamming
Low key, laid back
But we jamming
We go keep on jamming
Low key, laid back
But we jamming (keyboard)

Listen what I tell you
We are simple ones
But we well complex ooh
We are peaceful ones
Who know when fe vex
So if you don't dig the dreadlocks zone
You better leave it alone
'Cause I know JAH shall never let the
Children suffer
Because we irie, irie, irie
