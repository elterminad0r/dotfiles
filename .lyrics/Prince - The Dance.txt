I don't wanna give you my love
'Cause I don't wanna lose my mind
I don't wanna give you my love
'Cause if I do it's gonna be the last time
Ooh, ooh, ooh

'Cause I never want 2 feel this way again
If I can't be your lover
I don't wanna be your friend, no
I don't wanna be friends, no
Ooh, ooh

I don't wanna hold your hand, no (I don't wanna hold your hand)
'Cause I would just follow you everywhere, oh
I don't wanna see you dance (I don't wanna see U, girl)
'Cause I don't even really want 2 take the chance
Of fallin' in love with U, baby

If you ever said those beautiful words 2 me
"If I wanna be your fantasy," yes
I wanna dance, yes
Let's dance, sugar
Ooh ooh ooh, oh

I don't wanna give you my love

Oh baby, this must be temptation
'Cause I just can't get you off my mind
I try and try
But when I close my eyes
I see you every time

I don't wanna go 2 fast, ooh
'Cause if I do I just might stay (Stay with me)
I'd stay with you baby (Yeah)
I guess I better make it last (Make it last)
The longer that I feel this way (The longer that you feel this way, girl)
Ooh oh

'Cause I never want 2 feel this way again
If I can't be your lover
I don't wanna be your friend, no
I don't wanna be friends, no

I don't wanna give you my love, oh honey, baby (No no no)
Baby, r U gonna really just stand there
And act like you don't want this?
Baby, if you do then you know I just don't care
Oh baby, I could find another
Just like you anywhere
Oh baby, they might not have your hips, girl
And all that pretty hair, oh
At least they won't spend all day in the mirror
Tryin' 2 find somethin' 2 wear
At least, they won't wanna make love
Like you do on the stairs, against the pole on the north corner of the...
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, it's just not fair
It's just not fair!
Oww!
