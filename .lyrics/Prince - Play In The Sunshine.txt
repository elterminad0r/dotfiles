Ooh doggie!

We wanna play in the sunshine, we wanna be free
Without the help of a margarita or ecstacy
We wanna kick like we used to, sign up on the dotted line
We're gonna dance every dance like it's gonna be the last time

We got to play in the sunshine, turn all the lights up to ten
I wanna meet U (meet U) and kiss U (kiss U)
And love U (love U) and miss U (miss U)
Do it all over again, do it all over again

We're gonna play in the sunshine, we're gonna get over
I'm feelin' kind of lucky tonight, I'm gonna find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way (some way), somehow (somehow) I'm gonna have fun

Play in the sunshine

We gonna love all our enemies till the gorilla falls off the wall
We're gonna rock him (rock him)
We're gonna roll him (roll him)
We're gonna teach him that love will make him tall (so tall)

Ah, pop goes the music when the big white rabbit begin to talk
And the color green will make your best friend leave ya (walk)
It'll make them do "The Walk," but that's cool (that's cool)
'Cause one day (one day), every day (every day) will be a yellow day, let's play

(Play in the sunshine, we're gonna get over) Over
I'm feelin' kind of lucky tonight, I'm gonna find my four leaf clover
(Before my life is done) Before my life is done
Some way (some way), somehow (somehow) I'm gonna have fun

Now get loose

We're gonna play in the sunshine, we're gonna get over
I'm feelin' kind of lucky tonight, I'm gonna find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
I'm gonna, some way, somehow, have fun

(Play in the sunshine, we're gonna get over)
(I'm feelin' kind of lucky tonight, I'm gonna find my four leaf clover)
Before my life is done
Some way, somehow, I just got 2 have fun
