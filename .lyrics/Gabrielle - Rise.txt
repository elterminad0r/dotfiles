I know that it's over
But I can't believe we're through
They say that time's a healer
And I'm better without you
It's gonna take time I know
But I'll get over you

Look at my life
Look at my heart
I have seen them fall apart
Now I'm ready to rise again
Just look at my hopes
Look at my dreams
I'm building bridges from these scenes
Now I'm ready to rise again

Caught up in my thinking
(Yeah)
Like a prisoner in my mind
You pose so many questions
That the truth was hard to find
I better think twice I know
That I'll get over you

Look at my life
Look at my heart
I have seen them fall apart
Now I'm ready to rise again
Just look at my hopes
Look at my dreams
I'm building bridges from these scenes
Now I'm ready to rise again

Much time has passed between us
Do you still think of me at all?
My world of broken promises
Now you won't catch me when I fall

Look at my life
Look at my heart
I have seen them fall apart
Now I'm ready to rise again
Just look at my hopes
Look at my dreams
I'm building bridges from these scenes
Now I'm ready to rise again

Yes I'm gonna rise
Gonna make it all right
I'm gonna be
Who I wanna be
Yeah baby, yeah, yeah

I'm gonna make it all right
I'm gonna make it all right
