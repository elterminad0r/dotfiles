You got scars so do I
If I could I'd take'em all and make'em mine
But for now I'll play the part
and let you in just far enough for this to start
for this to start
I remember everything
when the fire of your heart
began to sting
I couldn't tell you all of my sins
much too scared of what the truth might bring

I've been lying from the start
you know it's tearing me apart
but would you really want the whole truth?
When I finally tell it all
will it be your wrecking ball
or the bitter taste you tried to hide as smooth
I know I took it all away
so let me give it all back to you, you
oh you you
give it all, give it all back to you

You reaped for truth
I tell no lies
every page outlined for you ends with goodbyes
I'm losing sleep, cause I write all night
always ends up with the words ,,november 9"
ohhh

I've been lying from the start
you know it's tearing me apart
but would you really want the whole truth?
When I finally tell it all
will it be your wrecking ball
or the bitter taste you tried to hide as smooth
I know I took it all away
so let me give it all back to you, you
oh you you
give it all, give it all back to you

Your heart is on fire and my soul's the flame
but the damage left behind us is not the same

so let me give it all back to you, you
oh you you
you you
give it all, give it all back to you
