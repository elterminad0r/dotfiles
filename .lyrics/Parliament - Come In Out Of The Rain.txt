Happiness and peace
Is getting more and more out of my reach
Violence and revolution
Seems to be all that the people wanna preach
You're gunning down your brothers
Molestin' your sisters and your mothers in the streets
Whoa-oh the President's talkin' 'bout change
But nobody's got sense enough to come in out of the rain Hey hey hey (whoa)
Hey hey hey (whoo)

When will the people start gettin' together?
Learnin' to live and love one another?
Hey hey hey now (oh)
When will the people stop fightin' each other?
Learning to give and help one another
Hey hey hey now (aow)

(Guitar solo)

War's my Golden Age
I've been shipped from the cradle to the grave
Put a gun in their hands
Saying it's your duty to kill another man
Guess somebody's been there to the mothers
Makin' widows of the sweethearts and lovers
And this is our land, mmhmm
The President's talkin' 'bout change
But nobody's got sense enough to come in out of the rain
Hey hey hey (oh)
Hey hey hey (whoo)

When will the people start gettin' together?
Learnin' to live and love one another?
Hey hey hey now (oh)
When will the people stop fightin' each other?
Learn to give and help one another
Hey hey hey now (aow)
