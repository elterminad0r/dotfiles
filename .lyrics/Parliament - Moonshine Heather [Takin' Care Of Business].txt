She sold some to the policeman
And the neighbours copped a grudge
She didn't give a damn you know
She sold some to the judge
And if you come down and out
And do not have a dime
You can come to her on Friday morning

And buy yourself some on time
Ain't that taking care of business
Ain't that taking care of business

It's not that she enjoy this life
Living outside the law
It's just that there are 14 kids
Their father died in the war
And each and every Sabbath day
She prays for all her sins
But reality says to her my child
Take care of your 14 kids
So she's taking care of business
So she's taking care of business

She'd sell some to the Frenchman,
The Blackman, or the Dutch
But one thing is for certain sure
They could not stand too much
100 proof - hers has got to be
The finest corn around
Lift you up when you're down and out
And bring your body down
'Cause she's taking care of business
'Cause she's taking care of business
