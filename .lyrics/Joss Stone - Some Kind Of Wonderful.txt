I don't need a whole lot of money,
I don't need a big fine car.
I got everything that a girl could want.
I got more than, than I can ask for.

I don't have to run around,
I don't have to stay out all night,
'Cause I got a sweet,
Sweet lovin' man,
And he knows just how to treat me right.

See my baby, he's all right,
See my baby, we're so tight,
Don't you know he is,
Some kind of wonderful, yes he is,
He's some kind of wonderful,
Don't you know he is,
Some kind of wonderful.

Oh hold it let me tell you one more thing'
Now when he holds me in his arms,
He sets my soul on fire.
And Ooh, when my baby kisses me,
My heart becomes filled with desire.

When he wraps his lovin' arms around me,
He almost drives me out of my mind,
I get these funny little feelings inside a me,
Chills run up and down my spine.

My baby, he's all right.
Me and my baby, we're so tight,
Don't you know he is,
Some kind of wonderful, yes he is,
Some kind of wonderful,
He is some kind of wonderful.

Now hold it let me know just one more thing
Is there anybody out there,
With a sweet little man like mine?
There's got to be somebody,
With a sweet little man like mine, O, O,

Now tell me ladies,
Can I get a witness (repeat).
Some kind of wonderful,
Don't you know he is,
Some kind of wonderful,
Don't you know he is,
Some kind of wonderful (repeat)
