I was wandering through the streets of the city
Rambling through the the avenues of time
When from nowhere my eyes fell onto a girl
And by chance her eyes fell onto mine
Ah...

So I sat and I acted all nonchalant
She smoked her lavender cigarette
Reading the future that lay in my hands
My shadow played a bass clarinet
Where are you going with this, Bret?

We waltzed down a moonlit boulevard
Just two silhouettes in the mist
Ah. yes?
Days went by and years went by
Moments went by when we kissed
When was this?

She said, "Your beard is woven of heartache
And we'll drink for the lonely tonight."
And the moon is a horny old drunkard
Ah, Bret. Could you please move over to your right?

We drank dandelion wine and we reminisced
About the moment when we first met that day
I'm trying to watch TV
Then we reminisced about how we first reminisced
Ah yeah. Sounds a bit gay

She handed me a broken memory
A keepsake to forevermore say
That a brief taste of love is as sweet as any
And with that, she made her way
Oh yeah. What was her name?

She said her name was a secret
Then she said her name was Cherie
Is her middle name Cherie, so It's a Secret Cherie, maybe?
Mm ... Maybe What did she look like?

She looked like a Parisian river
What? dirty?
She looked like a chocolate eclair
That's rare
Her eyes were reflections of eyes
Oh, nice
And the rainbows danced in her hair
Oh yeah...

She reminded me of a winter's morning
What, frigid?
Her perfume was eau de toilette
What's that mean?
She was comparable to Cleopatra
Quite old?
She was like Shakespeare's Juliet
Thirteen?!

The bohemians of Soho did pirouettes
As we waltzed through the streets of Manhattan
On rivers of ribbon and sailboats of song
Bret, did any of this actually happen?

The girl I described, she's as real as the wind
It's true I saw her today
The other details are inventions
Because I prefer her that way
