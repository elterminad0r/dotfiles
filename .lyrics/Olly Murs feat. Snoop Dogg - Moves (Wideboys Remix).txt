Big Snoop Dogg
You know we bout to make moves, ya dig?

I, walk in the club like a million bucks
First I hit the bar for a couple of shots
We get the beautiful women, I think I'm making them blush
Then I spill my drink tryna cover it up

Got the dad dance moves, staying ready for em
Got the Batman groove, go steady on em
Hey, se√±orita in a beautiful dress
Do ya, wanna dance? She's tellin' me yes

I got confidence in myself
But that's just the Tequila giving me help
Tryna cover it up, so you never tell
I feel like dancin' with you

It's your moves, baby
'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do
But I got that love that you ain't used to
(Hey)
And when the DJ's spinning that song that we groove to
(Oh my)
Come on teach me how to dance

Slow down!
DJ play that track
Check out my kung fu kicks
Like I'm under attack
I wave my arms like this from front to back
But you never seen a bad mother dance like that

Then you breaking me in with a kiss on the lips
Jump into the middle, come on wiggle your hips
My love, take my hand, I'll give you a spin
Step once, step twice, let the party begin

I got confidence in myself
But that's just the Tequila giving me help
Tryna cover it up, so you never tell
I feel like dancing with you

It's your moves, baby
'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do
But I got that love that you ain't used to
(Hey)
And when the DJ's spinning that song that we groove to
(Oh my)
Come on teach me how to dance

Dance to the rhythm of the d-o Dogg
G and the thug, watch how it be in the club
Looking, starin', daring, comparin
In my book they say sharing is caring

So give me a taste
And make your hips just dip to the bass
The watch me run the line
See what I come to fine

It's your moves, baby
'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do
But I got that love that you ain't used to
(Hey)
And when the DJ's spinning that song that we groove to
(Oh my)
Come on teach me how to dance

It's your moves dance
'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do
(In my book they say sharing is caring)
But I got that love that you ain't used to
(Dance to the rhythm of the d-o Dogg)
And when the DJ's spinning that song that we groove to
(You know we bout to make moves)
Come on teach me how to dance

Ya dig!
