It is said that when we leave this world
If we have suffered we will be saved
So I'll lift up my head whoever I am
What I cannot do here there's a place that I can

I'm waiting for the silent boatman
To ferry me across the unknown waters

In this life though I've tried
Many things couldn't be
Closed minds with faces looking down onto me
Parting means grief but only for those left
All men descend into earth at the very same depth

I'm waiting for the silent boatman
To ferry me across the unknown waters

I wonder if in death man at last can love man
Stripped of all life's gifts to him
No ego to remain
When you reach Jordan's banks there's no money
Power or fame
No third or second class the fare is all the same

I'm waiting for the silent boatman
To ferry me across the unknown waters
