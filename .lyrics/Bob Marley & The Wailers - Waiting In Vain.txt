I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

From the very first time
I placed my eyes on you, girl
My heart says follow through

But I know now that I'm
Way down on your line
But the waitin' feel is fine

So don't treat me like a
Puppet on a string
'Cause I know how to do my thing

Don't talk to me as
If you think I'm dumb
I wanna know
When you're gonna come

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

'Cause summer is here
I'm still waiting there
Winter is here
And I'm still waiting there

Like I said
It's been three years since I'm
Knocking on your door
And I still can knock some more

Ooh girl ooh girl
Is it feasible, I wanna know now
For I to knock some more

Ya see
In life I know
There's lots of grief
But your love is my relief

Tears in my eyes burn
Tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting
While I'm waiting for my turn

See, I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna I don't wanna
I don't wanna I don't wanna
I don't wanna wait in vain
I don't wanna I don't wanna
I don't wanna I don't wanna
I don't wanna wait in vain
It's your love that I'm waiting on
It's my love that you're running from
It's your love that I'm waiting on
It's my love that you're running from
