Why you screaming? You know I'm not a Man 'o' War.
Break the gold chain that I gave you, Throw it down on the floor.
Instead of this 7 page letter, I wish I had peace of mind.
My friends tell me, "You should go get her!"
But loving you, loving you, loving you... Is a waste of time.
Oh yes it is, a waste of time.

I need to get out of this city. I need to get you out of my head.
I need to get away from the words that you said to me.
Why you screaming? You know I'm not a Man 'o' War.
How could you even think that I would put something inside of someone
That, that I put inside you, inside you? Even if I tried to, if I tried to,
I couldn't 'cause I still smell like the last time that you spent the night.
But loving you, loving you, loving you... Is a waste of time.
Oh yes it is, loving you's a waste of time.

I need to feel wanted again. I need to feel love is in my life. yeah, yeah
I need to hear you say, that you ain't looking for another reason to make me cry.
Why you screaming? You know I'm not a Man 'o' War.
But I been trying to make you happy baby, ever since we were sophomores.
But loving you, loving you, loving you... Is a waste of time.
Oh yes it is, oh it's a waste of time, waste of time, waste of time.

If there is no future, then there is no past.
And all we've got is right now. Let's make it last, make it last, make it last.

I need to get out of this city. I need to get you out of my head.
I need to get away from the words that you said to me.
I need to feel wanted again. I need to feel no sin. Hear me.
But loving you, loving you, loving you...

You know I'm not a Man 'o' War
