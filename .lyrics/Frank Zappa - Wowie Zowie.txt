Wowie Zowie, your love's a treat
Wowie Zowie, you can't be beat
Wowie Zowie, baby you're so neat
I don't even care if you shave your legs

Wowie Zowie, baby you're so fine
Wowie Zowie, baby, please be mine
Wowie Zowie up and down my spine
I don't even care if you brush your teeth

(Ooh) I dream of you each mornin'
(Ooh) I dream of you each night
(Ooh) Just the other day I got so shook up
(Ooh) I dreamed of you in the afternoon

Baum didi, baum didi, baum didi
Baum didi, baum didi, baum didi
Mum, mum, mum, mum, mum

(Ooh) I dream of you each mornin'
(Ooh) I dream of you each night
(Ooh) Just the other day I got so shook up
(Ooh) I had a flash in the afternoon

Wowie Zowie, baby love me do
Wowie Zowie and I'll love you too
Wowie Zowie, baby I'll be true
I don't even care if your dad's the heat

Wowie Zowie
Wowie, Wowie Zowie
Wowie, Wowie Zowie
Wowie, Wowie Zowie
