Air, air
Air, air

Hit me in the face
I run faster, faster, faster, faster
Faster, faster into the air
I say to myself

"What is happening to my skin?
Where is that protection that I needed?
Air can hurt you too, air can hurt you too"

Some people say not to worry about the air
Some people never had experience with

Air, air
Air, air

It can break your heart
So remember, remember, remember, remember, remember
When the weather gets rough
You'll say to yourself

"What is happening to my skin?
Where is that protection that I needed?
Air can hurt you too, air can hurt you too"

Some people say not to worry about the air
Some people never had experience with

Air, air
Air, air
