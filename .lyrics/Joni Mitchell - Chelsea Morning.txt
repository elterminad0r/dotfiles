Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and
The first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window, and the
Traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells,
And rapping up like pipes and drums

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it till the night comes

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and
The first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtain, and
A rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome
You, crimson crystal beads to beckon

Oh, won't you stay,
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a
Portait of today
And the streets are paved with passerby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and
The first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a
Bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch
And stuck to all my senses

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the curtain closes and the
Rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning
